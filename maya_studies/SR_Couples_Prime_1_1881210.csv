5,"We were, I hate to say this. discussing his mother. it's been 17 years that she has spoken to us, we've gone thru a rough road because of that. This year she needed him, and we took her into our home. We all seemed like strangers, and were trying to get things going for her.

9,We were talking about what kind of porn we might be okay with doing if we absolutely didnt have a choice to do porn and got to pick. We randomly talk about weird things sometimes.,"Slightly judgemental, and curious as to why she picked the decision she picked. I usually don't have too much trouble seeing eye to eye with her on alot of things, but this time I did."

11,What to name our second child,"Frustrated and indecisive, somewhat unsupported"
12,Our child's recently discovered musical ability,Slightly surprised and very happy

17,"We were discussing what was deemed cultural appropriation, specifically the word ""happa."" I am part Japanese/white, and this word has been used proudly for people like me. We were discussing its origins as a Hawaiian term and my SO thought this was cultural appropriation, but was doubting my opinion and experience as being helpful that no, this doesn't fall under that category of offensively reclaiming another culture. ",I felt frustrated. I felt like he was arguing for the sake of being right and stubbornly refusing to see my points as valid. He also refused to see my experience and someone who has been actively involved in happa/Asian-American communities since childhood as something legitimate.
18,I imagined us discussing a financial situation in which we couldn't agree on what the correct steps to take were.,"I felt slightly annoyed that we couldn't come to a consensus, however I wasn't angry. We just weren't communicating the same ideas."

",I felt frustrated because we both came from very different experiences and neither of us knew what schooling was like based on the other persons past experience.  
21,"My wife, children, and I have recently moved half way across the country. Since our arrival, just over one year ago, we have yet to feel settled. Everything is different. The people, the geography, the weather, the food...everything. We are not happy here and we often talk about our plans for moving home. The problem is, however, that we like to eat and pay our bills so in order to move home a job is required. We have four young children so finding work that pays enough to suuport us all is not an easy task. In our most recent conversation regarding this topic we both felt the urge to move back, yet it was somewhat stronger than usual because we were feeling particularly isolated at the time. I had just undergone surgery to remove a kidney stone just before that our youngest child, who is an infant, fell out of a chair he had climbed into and bumped his head on the tile floor. We panicked and took him to the ER. He was fine, however, that trip lightened our bank account by over $2K. I guess you can put a price on peace of mind. ANyway, we felt especially close when talking about moving home for these and other reasons. We have just had it here and we're ready to leave.","During the conversation I felt sad for having moved my family out here for a job. It's a great job and I'm making more money than I ever have, however, I do not fel that is worth th eemotional toll that we are paying."
22,Romantic relationships and times that you did not agree with your partner,neutral
23,We were discussing where we see our life in 10 years and how we want to spend our money now so that we can get there. We agreed saving now was important but also that we should buy things for the house that will increase our property value. We talked about how we want to get engaged in the next year. How we want to have a family in the next 3-8 years so it is important what we do now. We were really on the same page on all accounts.,I felt that we were on the completely same page and had the same goals and aspirations for the future. I felt that our love was very strong and everything would be okay and we would be able to achieve everything we desired as long as we had each other. 
24,"We were dicussing our wedding, about what each of us wanted to happen.",I was angry and disappointed at times.
25,"We were discussing politics, more specifically how worthy of a candidate Bernie Sanders would be for the 2016 presidential election.",I felt like my husband was making an uninformed decision about which he was being extremely obstinate.
26,"We were discussing for the first time about our thoughts on the future. For instance, when we thought we would get engaged, graduate, move in together, get married, etc. We both had different ideas and it was hard to understand each other. ",I felt confused. I also wondered if my boyfriend was as committed as he states he is. I felt like I was missing part of a puzzle. 
27,"We had just had our second baby, a little boy, and we went out to lunch. We were both so happy that we were married and raising a family together. It was a really nice moment that I will always remember.",I felt very connected and that I was where I wanted to be in my life. I felt very lucky to have found someone to be a partner with both as a parent and as a companion. I was very happy.
28,Our living situation and what to do about our lifestyle,"I would probably feel interested and invested, very interested in knowing about the future."
29,"We were sitting on the porch of our then-residence, which was owned by my partner's father. He had just told me I had three days to get my things and leave, and did so with rather graphic language. This stemmed from an incident the day prior that was between my partner and I, and no one else. We were both defending things that had happened as well as ourselves (mostly me, as I was blamed for the entire situation even though I was not fully responsible), and it was the one time that very much stands out as us being truly on the same page about everything, despite being shouted down and called names.","I actually felt very connected, like my partner was able to read my thoughts exactly. While our situation was not yet resolved, we were still able to work as a pair to communicate what we needed to communicate."
30,"We were discussing not hanging out so much and doing his work around the home as we agreed, he has negative influences around himself.  I tried to get him to do positive things with his life.","I was furious because I do my work and I try to,do my best and he does not put in enough effort in my opinion.  So I am very angry with him."
31,"We were discussing religion, and topics of those nature. She is very religious, and I am not, and it's probably the only rift that we have in our relationship. Whenever I think about this question at hand, as in ""What problems would you say you have between you and your wife"" - this is the only thing that comes to mind. Unfortunately, its a pretty big problem, but I try to not let it be. I am respectful of her beliefs, I just wish she were more open to accepting my lack of belief. I do not ever bring up the topic, nor do I try to 'convert' her. I wish she would extend the same courtesy to me in some situations. ","I felt just awful and helpless. I cannot just simply change my worldview because someone asks me to. I cant just unlearn topics that I am borderline expert in. I feel bad because I know she has these religious convictions, and she wants to share them with her partner.  Unfortunately, I do not share these, and therefore its a problem to her. I have no problem with our son being exposed to religion in any way, but I am not going to ""fake it"" for him. I want my son to think for himself like his father, and determine his beliefs on his own accord. "
32,We were talking about moving,I felt as if we were on the same page. Our goals matched with our future.
33,"We were on our first date, talking about our mothers and our tastes in music and tattoos. ","Amazing, like she understood exactly who I was and what I was about after only being with her for a few hours."

38,"We were discussing when would be a good time to start our family.We both wanted to have children while we were young enough to physically really enjoy playing outdoors with our kids, go camping, take family hikes, etc. We were at a pretty stable financial point and each of us was secure in our careers  so we decided to take the plunge.","Excited, happy and a bit scared all at once. I also felt very close to my husband."
39,"We were walking on a beach taking about view on life and plans to undertake in the future. She started to bring out the point of raising a dog and a baby simultaneously so that the baby can grow to love another living thing, learn to live with it. it was something that i had always thought about and the fact that we shared the same view, made me so happy and connected with her.","I felt the feeling of knowing her for the longest time, and gelled immediately. "
40,we were discussing finances.,angry
41,"We were discussing how one person was giving off a bad vibe.  As in one person took the others behavior as not very pleasant, based on cues.  Such as facial expressions and the way person would respond or make statements.  Person A denied having any bad feelings and yet all of the ways they were acting said otherwise. Person B had a hard time understanding that really there was nothing at all that was bothering person A, and wanted to talk about what was wrong so it could be fixed.  Person B was feeling bad because although person A said they were fine, they were not pleasant to be around and maintained their stance that they were not unhappy.","I felt very emotionless and blank, because this conversation had happened before.  I felt done."
42,"We were recently discussing our son who is leaving home in a few weeks to become a Navy officer.  We were both talking about while we are a bit anti-military, we had a bit of a laugh at the rebellion of children no matter how the parents tend to be.  We are proud and sad and both are so parallel on this issue. ",Happy and sad.  Happy that this man and I brought up a smart boy however a boy who is such a square it is beyond belief. Sad that he's growing up and leaving us. 
43,We were discussing what to do with our income tax refunds.  We had put them together and were deciding what to do with them.  I wanted to pay some smaller bills and then save the rest for taking a trip later in the year.  He wanted to invest it for use in years to come.,"We both wanted to save the money.  During the conversation I could hear that part, but it seemed as to what we were saving the money for was being missed by each person.  I know we were both getting frustrated."
44,We were discussing his younger sister who is always begging for money all of the time. He wanted to complain about giving her money but does not want to stop giving it to her because she is his little sister. I feel that I would not let my brother take advantage of me like that and this is where we had an difference in opinion.,I just felt like I would not have handled the situation the way he handled it.
45,Taking out a loan so we could buy some cars in Texas to sell in Costa Rica.,Hopeful and elated. We have the resources and contacts to do it and it would be a good business opportunity.
46,We were discussing who we thought should run for president after Obama. We are both republicans  but didnt really agree.,I felt frustrated since she likes Trump and I think he is terrible for being president.

50,wether to move back to Pennslyvania from Ohio,Very happy and connected
51,"We were discussing the amount of time we spent together and my husband's habits of going out at night to be with his friends. Specifically, we were discussing how I felt that he was going out a lot and spending many hours a week with his friends and then spending time with me just watching tv and doing other non-interactive activities. I remember that this argument came after a week in which he'd gone out 5 of the 7 nights, and when he goes out he stays out for 6 hours or so, sometimes more, until 2am. I go out too, we're both very social people and our social circles don't overlap at all, but when I go out (2-3 times a week) I go for an hour, maybe two, to things like dinner or happy hour or a movie, and am home by 8pm. To me it's not the same thing at all.","I felt that he was not understanding me. And I felt that the bigger picture was that he didn't value his time with me as much as he did with his friends. While I could accept just getting caught up in the moment and going out whenever  his (single) friends texted him, I couldn't figure out what was keeping him from understanding where I was coming from when I was pointing it out to him point blank."
52,where to go out to eat.,I felt my decision was the better option
53,The fact that his selfishness was handed down to him by his Mother.,Like he was thinking I was a terrible person to even think about what I was saying to him about his Mother and himself.
54,"We were discussing how we would approach food for our daughter. I am of an older thought that whatever is made for dinner/lunch is what you get to eat, you do not get a special thing made for you that meal if the child does not choose to eat it. /  / My wife is of the thought that they need food so if they say they do not like something they get a special meal just for them.",I was frustrated because I couldn't get her to see why making special meals is (to me) a bad thing that leads to future picky eaters and more work for me since I do all of the cooking.
55,We were talking about our son and how he was doing at college.  I wanted to check in with him and my husband did not feel it was necessary or needed.  I felt like we were 2 boats passing on the water at night. He could not seem to understand why we should check in with him and to me it was very clear and obvious,Like I was talking to myself!  Very frustrated!
56,we were discussing future plans to live on a sailboat,I felt excited about the future.
57,We were discussing the possibility of moving or staying where we are now and raising our kids.  I am very open to moving different places and my wife wants to stay put and stay near family - which seems stifling to me.,"Very annoyed and awkward, like this couldn't possibly be my life, for the rest of my life."
58,Our life goals.  How we just want to be successful.  How we want to have kids and raise them wisely.  We were on the same page about parenting.  We also talked about the type of place we want to live.  ,"I felt in tune with him, I felt also relieved that we shared the same views."

60,We were discussing  going to court to get custody of his daughter.,I felt like he wasn't listening to my perspective and a little upset he wasn't considering my feelings in the matter.
61,"We were discussing ourselves for the first time in person to each other.  We shared what we valued in life, what we wanted out of life, how we wanted to live life, what we wanted to explore and experience.  While we were talking and sharing one another with each other, we realized that we share a lot of the same values and want a lot of the same things out of life.  We also shared things about ourselves in the moment and we were so different from one another it intrigued both of us to learn even more about one another.","I felt excited, intrigued, curious, moved, happy, nervous, thrilled, joyful and just a slight bashful."
62,We were discussing marriage. We could just not compromise on a date for the wedding. I was thinking the first day of spring and she was thinking the first day of fall.,I felt like I wasn't being heard and my input was invalid.
63,"After we had our son,. I wanted to go back to work. My husband disagreed. He thinks that women should stay home with the children and raise them so that a stranger doesn't have to.,",Like what I wanted didn't matter. And it really hurt our relationship every  time I brought up that I wanted to work.
64,an incident where he wouldn't talk to me for awhile because he was mad before we were dating and he still thinks i was wrong even though i wasn't,frustrated - and like he isn't very trustworthy - in terms of his evaluation of truth
65,We were discussing our 16 year old son and his girlfriend being expectant parents.,"I was irate. Furious, I couldn't even imagine what was going to happen to the plans these 2 bright children had for their futures now."
66,I do not get along with my mother we have had a on and off relationship since I was a child. I had been wronged by my mother and didn't wish to speak with her anymore.

67,We were discussing our future child.,"Joyful, calm, loved."

69,"We were discussing support of Bernie Sanders for president. We both believe in equality and that people at the bottom need help. We also both support unions and the idea that government should be a regulator to make sure people get fairness, but should not be the gatekeepers for morality such as abortion and gay marriage.",I felt connected with my spouse and like we validated each others opinions and feelings. We felt close and like we belonged together. It created warm feelings of belonging.
70,We were talking about moving out of state,"I felt anxious, I just wanted to get the move over with."
71,"We were discussing a news story featuring a presidential candidate. We had each read the story separately, but when we talked  about it later that day, we both drew the same conclusions, not only about the persons actions, but what the likely result of it would be. ","We actually both thought it was very funny. I felt very giddy and close to her, like we were on the same page, and thought the same way. It was a good feeling. "
72,Money,Anxious
73,our children and their decisions,great like we agreed
74,"One of the dogs had just slipped off the leash while we were out walking, he had started to bolt.but stopped. We were discussing how to approach him without getting him to bolt again. She seemed to think he would just sit still and wait for us, I thought that we had to be careful and calm and quiet to avoid making him run again. She seemed to think this had happened a few times before, I felt like I would have remembered. It was late after midnight,close to the swamps, in a strange neighborhood that we didn't typically walk through (even during the day)","The whole night was a little weird, I felt  a little spacey and a bit lightheaded. It was also pretty warm that night, summer was coming on but it was even a little warm for the spring."

77,Having a child.,Very happy and looking forward to the event.
78,"We were discussing something that we talk about from time to time, his side of the family and all the issues that go with it!  This could mean anything from his very nosy and sometimes bossy mother who plays favorites way too much, to his dad who is a bit delusional about some people and things, as are both parents.  Furthermore, his many siblings and all the other drama that they bring into our world, mostly because of their lack of moral character when it comes to being a good Christian parent, something I agree on with him.  So, even though the conversations may be negative in nature, we do enjoy being able to discuss the ridiculousness of his family on a regular basis; and are generally on the same wavenlength about it.","I usually feel excited, and a bit energetic, because it is sadly engaging and entertaining discussing the madness of relatives."
79,Our lives together and how much we meant to each other.,Very warm-intense emotion.

83,Finances.,Awkward.
84,"anything that had to do with our son when he was growing up never seemed to sync or merge with both of us. My hubby is a laid back sort of person who had rather let things slide and I have a temper so anytime we tried to come up with a way of dealing with things our son did wrong  we just could not seem to come together and agreed.It didn't matter what it was, but we usually either let it go and I was the bad person or nothing got done. Because when we wouldn't agree , hubby would rather walk away and leave the room than fuss about it.",I was always hurt by it.I felt like in each case he was taking our son's side no matter what or how much wrong he done. It would upset me more and disappoint me also.But through the years I never got used to him being that way. He just was one way and I am another ...
85,"I know it sounds silly, but the first thing that came to mind was a time when we were on ""date night"" at the movies.  We were standing in line trying to figure out which candy to get with our popcorn.  We both stared at the case for a few seconds, and then at the EXACT same time, we said, ""Peanut M&Ms?""  We both smiled at each other and I felt so much love for him at that moment.  I know it's such a small thing, but I think it's those small things that make a relationship wonderful.","I really felt a genuine wave of complete love and happiness.  We know each other so well that we both know what the other would enjoy (or what we both would compromise on).  I felt insanely connected to him, and he became ten times sexier to me."
86,"Several years ago my husband and I were discussing whether to sell our house and move.  We had been living in the same house for many years but wanted to buy something more modern (our house was 75 years old).  We were somewhat hesitant about selling, moving and buying another house for a number of reasons.",I was feeling a bit scared.  I was also concerned that we might not be making the right decision.
87,"My husband is a professional violinist and he was testing a new violin bow against one he currently owns. He asked me to listen (without knowing which bow he was playing) and give my feedback. I was reluctant to do so since I am not a musician, but I gave it a go and described the sound differences as best I could. It turned out he described the sound differences in the same way and had the same opinion.","Respected, equal."
88,religion,involved
89,Our children's progress at school.,Like we were on the same page and that I was being heard.
90,It was a few days after I told him I was going to break up with him. We were discussing the thing that he needed to change for our relationship to work.,I was felt so happy that for once he was taking me seriously and actually listening. I could feel that he was scared of losing me and really wanted us to work which made me so happy.
91,Nothing.,Cool.
92,We were discussing our religious preferences and beliefs,"I felt like it was a trivial difference and it wasn't really something I cared about, but he wanted to argue about it so I was frustrated"
93,"We were living together and decided to make our first big purchase, a new car. My boyfriend wanted a SUV, but I wanted a compact car. I felt the SUV was too much of a gas guzzler and the upkeep would be more expensive, and my boyfriend disagreed. ","I felt quite irritated that he could not agree with  my rational thinking. I felt he was going more for the status of owning a SUV, rather than being practical about it. I felt a bit deflated that he was not respecting my opinion at all. "
94,"Most of our couple friends aren't as trusting with each other as we are. For example, couple friend 1, Jane doesn't have male company while John is away, John has to call in a few times a day to check in with Jane, they are actually quite loving towards each other and neither complain about the other but we both find the arrangement to be a bit odd. My sig. other has plenty of female friends, coworkers, etc... and has lunch with them, maybe a beer after work. I have several male friends that I frequently visit, they visit me, we do things together. Neither of us is particularly jealous, suspicious, or have any qualms about one another having friends of the opposite sex. We trust each other completely. There are no required call-ins or check ups, only to say hello or I love you. We agree that out relationship is stronger because of the trust that we have in each other and that trusts subsequent freedoms.","I felt amazing. I know what it's like to have a sig. other that lacks trust, makes for a hard life. I felt secure, trusted, loved, trusting, in-tune, compatible. "

100,We were discussing some issues that had come up recently and how we view handling certain situations.,I felt very defensive and upset.
101,I can't even remember what we were discussing. We were having an argument. Into the argument at some point she was saying I did or said something. I was saying there is no way I said or did that. But then after a while I realized she was right. It's funny how I don't even remember what was being argued just what happened.,I felt very angry and upset. I was not happy. I remember also being very confused when I realized she was right.
102,"we were discussing the fact that i feel he has disconnected our intimacy.  i feel very alone at times & i also feel as though i am ""bothering"" him whenever i speak to him.  ",i felt that i was not being validated -- he disagreed with me & bluntly told me i was wrong to feel that way.

105,"We were discussing his parents wanting to possibly baptize our children, and I am firmly against that, so we just kind of fell out of sync there, as he didn't see it as a big deal and I did. So we stopped talking for a while.","Angry, confused, and like I was less important that his parent's wishes, because they are my children and I should get to decide."
106,"We were discussing whether to stay in our current area or move, possibly as far as another state, to have a better quality of life in an environment we enjoy more. ","Connected, in sync.

"
107,We were dicussing how to handle our daily chores around the house.,Like she just didn't understand where I was coming from.
