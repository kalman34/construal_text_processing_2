310,322,You seem really surprised. ,,,,
310,321,"Oh yeah. I'm good. So, uh, career choices. Actually, I-I felt-- I realized a career choice with a regis-- um, I mean, eventually, you just end up in Hong Kong so and I will be like almost--",,,,
310,322,"No, I don't think so. Maybe--",,,,
310,321,"I mean, you want your Ivy league. And there's no chance to get in an Ivy league job in America.",,,,
310,322,"No, I'm not necessarily Ivy league since today I have attended a accurate solution at citizen treaty. I think the--",,,,
310,321,We should turn the lights off.,,,,
310,322,Oh.,,,,
310,322," And the, the-- I think the trading is a really interesting job for me.",,,,
310,321," Yeah, I know.",,,,
310,322, Yeah.,,,,
310,321," Uh, I-I might do training here. I don't know.",,,,
310,322, And actively go to that so forth. Mm-hmm.,,,,
310,321," But I-I felt sales and trading are interesting but I don't know what are the chances. Whenever I finish the application, it's unlikely we'll need to like find more. Um, uh I don't know. I mean you or-or your commitment so much in-in your previous applications unlikely would change. Um, uh, all I say I-- sometimes I feel like you don't know really know what you want in your career. Me either. So um--",,,,
310,322," Yeah, I'm just-- I try still, trying some stuff for a time, for us there will be other chance for you ",,,,
310,321, I mean it's a chance--,,,,
310,322, Yeah.,,,,
310,321, So.,,,,
310,322, And we'll definitely be me and you--,,,,
310,321," And-and you always commenting in our relationship so far and um, you're saying it's just a chance and you're not really-- I feel like you're not really making any efforts. I mean, you're-- sometimes I feel like you're just a child and trying ""Oh this is fun, this is interesting, really. Just do that and --"" It makes me feel like you're never like really seriously consider anything maturely. And you don't really include me in your con-consideration at all. I only cons-- at first consider, ""Okay. If you really go to Hong Kong, maybe someday I will quit my job and join you."" But that's what's my consideration for you. But on your side, you never like really consider--",,,,
310,322," Okay. But I think have, uh, doing my job, I mean job searching in America. Since all the--",,,,
310,321," I mean, some of the-- you are always like consider what's best for you. What's best for yourself but when we are already in a relationship, you never wanna consider me. I considered you but you barely consider me. So that's why I don't even want to try Hong Kong because there's no point 'cause they're not for real. I don't wanna make the efforts 'cause you're not. You are like sometimes being so controlling thinking that I should be the one who would contribute to our relationship then you should do it but actually it's not.",,,,
310,322," Yeah, so I'm, uh, really trying also on the job in the United States. I think since most of the information etcetera I have attended, uh, part of it at the US. So I-I'm-I'm actually, uh, working equally waiting out there where as in the Hong Kong ones. But just the many calls I have gotten career strong in Hong Kong. So now, you prepare more for focus interns, um, but in general, I will cause a better ",,,,
310,321, I don't know but and that thing is-- I don't think you are happy with that.,,,,
310,322, Mm-hmm.,,,,
310,321," And I hate it's like that. It's never listen to you. Like sometimes, I have to be so aggressively demonstrating my point at you would ever listen to me. But you would just ignore everything that I say-- that I saying gently or nicely. You would just ignore it. And I feel-- I feel like you don't respect me at all. Sometimes I say a larger thing and you just forget about it and you don't even care.",,,,
310,322, There are moments you talk more about the career choice than--,,,,
310,321," I mean yeah, career choice. That's what I thought. I mean, you don't give a shit of what I suggest like, fill in the whole application before it's too late entirely. Maybe you should treasure it and because your character now should get better. But you might not be needing it anyway. You prefer-- I let you go, I hear others opinion or your mom. I-I don't see it. Now you realize training is good for you.",,,,
310,322, And it's not like I realize that--,,,,
310,321, But it's way too late.,,,,
310,322, But I have I applied for some-some of the sales in training and some of the ,,,,
310,321, I mean but it's trainings.,,,,
310,322, Then it's not true in that I have put almost equally waiting out to do that.,,,,
310,321," It's crazy to that when you're like separate or I mean, last term-- I guess I talked to a friend. Um, and I go about it and he said, the reason why-- did I tell you last week, about my failures when we were a child with efforts in Gangdong. It's because I was trying to mend things. You're not I say, you're not a genius. You can't just sit in area well. You have to focus. It's very competitive. If you do that, you put over here and there and there. You won't be able to get any of them actually.",,,,
310,322," Yeah, but now--",,,,
310,321, You have to have a focus and you already have focus.,,,,
310,322," Yeah, now I'm focused more on the editing part of it. I think the assessment training that-- in the other put more emphasis.",,,,
310,321," But why? Like when I tell you that your character is mostly the real bad, you don't listen at all. You have to wait three months, drawing those inventive right now. But when I told you, you just don't listen.",,,,
310,322," No, I'm not saying now anymore instead of training but, uh, I think maybe I will put a bit, uh, more emphasize on the trading job in US and the Ivy league jobs in Hongkong. It's for you and me, preparation?",,,,
310,321," Um, you know, um, it feels weird--um--",,,,
310,322, Sorry?,,,,
310,321," Yeah, maybe.",,,,
310,322, And also there is jobs in the US. That's interesting. What do you think of the place?,,,,
310,321, I don't know--I thought--,,,,
310,322, You won't consider a place here?,,,,
310,321," I am applying for this job but--the  is not what I, is not what I want--Um, it's whether they want me--The job market is very competitive.",," is not what I, is not what I want--Um, it's whether they want me--The job market is very competitive.",,
310,322, So what else are you considering in the US?,,,,
310,321," Uh, probably so--To see what I, yeah, apply for this job.",,,,
310,322,for salesmanship?,,,,
310,321," I'm really nervous because I don't think I find this job so, New Yorker's job and it's so important. Um--",,,,
310,322, Maybe it's kinda -- a base opportunity.,,,,
310,321," Uh, yeah, so I--I honestly don't know.",,,,
310,322, So how hard are you prepared for the green book?,,,,
310,321," Oh, I'm learning it, I'm learning brainteasers, and a little bit of calculus. I think it would go for the probability, in a way to the financial knowledge. It's, It's a-actually an interesting book, in terms of ",,,,
310,322, Have you read the green book? The ,,,,
310,321," Yeah, yeah, yeah. And her ",,,,
310,322," Oh yeah, have you read any problem in that book?",,,,
310,321," No, I hadn't. They post many questions. Uh, I feel like I'll sure read the green book first, and then, the how much far I guess you can reach",,,,
310,322," No, that means you really have to read.",,,,
310,321," Hmm... I don't know, I-- it frustrates me that it'll cost the same, and-- And I really don't know whether... And I feel like I am, I am stressed, and-- sometimes, I feel like I just don't want to work. Yeah, you should be the one who's working on this thing. ",,,,
310,322, Hmm? What?,,,,
310,321, You should be the one who's working and I'm staying at home. ,,,,
310,322," Yeah, that's also a good choice.",,,,
310,321," No, no, I'm not doing that.",,,,
310,322," You don't want, then- then, either if you don't work",,,,
310,321,  I want to stay in the US.,,,,
310,322, Hmm?,,,,
310,321, I want to stay in the US.,,,,
310,322," Yeah, that's correct. So you want definitely in US and not considering any job in Hong Kong?",,,,
310,321," Yeah. Yes. After all, I only apply for the in Hong Kong. So--",,,,
310,322," I'm, I'm now focusing more on US too... So it's actually, uh, just a, maybe if somewhere, consider a more big name... so it doesn't matter ",,,,
310,321, How many applications you needed for America this time?,,,,
310,322, Mm-hmm?,,,,
310,321," How many, how many times did you apply for America this time?",,,,
310,322," Thirty, or for- Fifty, I think.",,,,
310,321, In America?,,,,
310,322," Yeah, and mainly focus on sales and training and research and-- Yeah.Almost all the have applied for.",,,,
310,321, Hmm. Have you reached out?,,,,
310,322," It is not fun. Yeah? Yeah, reach out, yeah. I've definitely reached out to some of them. It's better to check them more than once, but uh, I think it's more important for us to or just, I think it's--",,,,
310,321," Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I think it's so much more.",,,,
310,322," I will -- actually, more like the small companies in the US, and the big one in New York.",,,,
310,321," Hmmm. Yeah, maybe, and then we realize what happened. And, I don't know, parents don't want me going back ",,,,
310,322, Yeah. Certainly.,,,,
310,321," I--I don't want to disappoint them, and I can't do long distance.",,,,
310,322, True.,,,,
310,321," And... What's your plan in general? Americans, they know their career path in three or five years...",,,,
310,322, Hmm?,,,,
310,321, Have you ever considered your career path in three or five years?,,,,
310,322," It depends on my, uh, job. So what kind of program? I think, maybe you work in the company, um-",,,,
310,321, Yeah.,,,,
310,322," -at least for five years, until you get a social relation?",,,,
310,321," I see.  I'm just curious, in this interview question that I ask, what is your short term and long term goal of this thing?",,,,
310,322," Ah, short term and long term goal-",,,,
310,322," I will say uh, in the long term, I hope that I will become the leader in this department. And, uh, be able to, uh, see part of them and the others who might come into meeting our--that direction, and be more experienced, and, uh, have more client resource. And for short term of that dream, do that my job and uh, and just with my position, yeah, must be all job-related and department-related, I don't know I'm saying? I don't know.",,,,
310,321," Okay. Have you e-ever considered, what if eventually, you got a job, I mean, full time, in Hong Kong, then I got offered a job in America?",,,,
310,322," Uh. I think that's not a problem since I think after, after, the--ultimately I can't afford to have a job in New York, in the US. It's not.  Yeah.",,,,
310,321," What do you mean? Like, what if I got entrepreneur job in the US? And you got, like, how is it, like a, a bad decision in Hong Kong, would you, would you want to choose from?",,,,
310,322," I would say, uh-- I actually think I will get, also get a pretty good job in New York. If not, I will, uh, try to first join the company in Hong Kong, then try to move here.",,,,
310,321, That's your plan?,,,,
310,322," But I will mostly doesn't think that, uh, I will definitely get, uh, a full time position in New York.",,,,
310,321," Why are you so sure? I mean, probably for some position, the Hong Kong chance is better than the US chance.",,,,
310,322," Yeah, but I--You mean, big name--But I, actually, I will choose this morning, a word, ",,,,
310,321, So--What do--Hmmm. So-- There's actually not much to talk about.,,,,

339,365, Like I?ve been so happy not having to deal with my family at all.,,,,
339,366," As long as my family respects that we don?t have to talk to my dad, things are fine.",,,,
339,365, Yea,,,,
339,366, Things are fine but they wanted you to get property in their area.,,,,

339,366, I know it?s been really nice.,,,,
339,365, And they just ? ,,,,
339,366, They constantly just crazy like you don?t know what psycho thing they are going to do next.,,,,
339,365, I mean yeah I think that you know obviously no incorporating my side of the family into our relationship whatsoever is the best way to go about it.,,,,
339,366,  it?s like your parents drag everyone else into their shitty relationship?,,,,
339,365, I mean yeah ,,,,
339,366," Like I still can?t believe they wanted me to weigh in on, like, their marital problems like the day that I met them . I can?t I can?t these people like .",,,,
339,365," They blew it, they blew it like right away. Like any chance of having a relationship with you.",,,,
339,366, Also when your mom called my doctor to try to get them to give them my test results.,,,,
339,365, That was so inappropriate. ,,,,
339,366, That was so crazy ,,,,
339,365," Asking about you, they like don?t really want any of the background or whatever. They?ve just given up on everything?",,,,
339,365, ?like I think at this point that I?m not talking to them at all talking to you is so far off the table because right now they are so desperate to have a relationship with me. That they are not even considering the possibility of?,,,,
339,366, But like they didn?t care about you when I was interacting with them because your father would just like sit there and speak German and like ,,,,
339,365,I just like remember like even with like the shadow of like your  they like hang over it. You know we had so much fun at that Mexican place or when like?,,,,
339,366," Well it?s awful  my family has like. Like, at funerals and stuff , their always like flirting.",,,,
339,365, Why shouldn?t they. ,,,,
339,366, I don?t know if it?s like a cultural thing.,,,,
339,365," It?s like I just never like I never had a big family, I guess now there?s a big family in Hamburg, but I?m like not a part of that?",,,,
339,366, Yea,,,,
339,365, You know what no one in our family is. They wouldn?t have named their kid Mutz which is like two letters away from mutis (sp?).,,,,
339,366," Yea, they thought that you were close.",,,,
339,365,I,,,,
339,366," It?s like, yea",,,,
339,365,"Like obviously there is no, this is while my brother was living there is like, I think that, no, what I do, I do I really want?",,,,
339,366, But that?s because they hate your mom.,,,,
339,365, I?m like I?m self-conscious. I hate her so much. It?s hilarious. Everyone in my family hates her.,,,,
339,366, Your dad most of all .,,,,
339,365," Except for my brother, he?s like obsessed with her.",,,,
339,366," Oh yea, motherboy.",,,,
339,365," I was just so, like it?s funny because when we were hanging out with your, I can?t believe his middle name is motherfucker, like when we were hanging out with your mother at the Mexican restaurant I was so self-conscious they wouldn?t like me and then I was just like?",,,,
339,366," I don?t know why you worry, my family?",,,,
339,365, I don?t know like remember when I?,,,,
339,366," Oh right because you heard everybody gossip about, um?",,,,
339,365, Corey,,,,
339,366, About Corey,,,,
339,365," Yeah, well I just?",,,,
339,366," Yea but, I mean, nobody hides it, so you would know if they were gossiping about you.",,,,
339,365, I know.,,,,
339,366, You know everybody just hasn?t reached a consensus,,,,
339,365,"I was like, we were like sharing food because we didn?t know Taylor was going to pay for it ?",,,,
339,365," ?and then I left you like one of each things, like I left you like a piece of shrimp and a piece of each of the vegetables, and your family thought that was so, like?",,,,
339,366, Well I mean I really wasn?t hungry though.,,,,
339,365, No I know,,,,
339,366, And  to go,,,,
339,365," They were like ?aww? and I was like I didn?t mean it like that. I just like always do that you gotta . Is that not a thing that other people do? No I just like really, I really liked your family.",,,,
339,366, My family is easy.,,,,
339,365, Like once your dad?s?,,,,
339,366, Yeah and Christopher really looks up to you.,,,,
339,365, Does he?,,,,
339,366," Yea, Christopher thinks you?re so cool.",,,,
339,365," Really. That?s so weird to me. I thought Lance was so cool when I first met him. But then like I remember, like, when we were hanging out with him again, I, like, saw him as an equal.",,,,
339,366, Yea the age difference is a lot more ? when we started going out.,,,,
339,365," Yea like, yea when we first met like when we first were",,,,
339,366, It?s weird for me too because I think of him as a lot older.,,,,
339,365," Alright like it was weird because like when we first hung out like back in 2012 or whatever, when I first met him I really saw like that he was so cool and like, like you have such a cool older brother and like I could see like a lot of you in him and, like, politically and stuff, but I never, I didn?t think of him as like an equal, you know. And then we were just like hanging out at your granny?s house, I like, there was no point where I like, thought I was?",,,,
339,366, It was weird,,,,
339,365," Yea, it was just weird because he?s like what, 32? ",,,,
339,366,Yea,,,,
339,365," He?s not like at a life stage where he?s like, cause let?s say",,,,
339,366, I know we?re at the same life stage.,,,,
339,365," Let?s say we?re in a parallel universe where Lance, you know?",,,,
339,365," Like, like you know someone who went to like a 9-5 job in like a three piece suit at like a bank or something and like worked?",,,,
339,366, Yeah,,,,
339,365," You know, and then it would be, then I would feel like I?m, like I?m not the adult that he is, and it?s like, I like your brother but obviously it was more like",,,,
339,366, Mhm,,,,
339,365," No I, I really want your family to like me though, that?s like so important to me",,,,
339,366," I don?t want my dad, I would never want to be with someone who my dad liked",,,,
339,365," Oh! Well yeah. Yea I mean, he?s the biggest, it sucks. I mean I think that you need to make sure that you don?t let your dad take your family away from you. ",,,,
339,366, Their not his family.,,,,
339,365," Well yeah, but he?",,,,
339,366, My mom?s side of the family?,,,,
339,365, Well yea but there was like a month over this summer that we were talking about going and ,,,,
339,366, and I got too scared.,,,,
339,365, you get like panic-y about the thought of having to see that piece of shit again.,,,,
339,366, Because he did try to like ambush us.,,,,
339,365, Yea,,,,
339,366, That was an apology,,,,
339,365, No,,,,
339,366, No,,,,
339,365," That was really satisfying, god",,,,
339,366, Yea I really enjoyed,,,,
339,365," Like, no he?s, like you shouldn?t",,,,
339,366,  like easier,,,,
339,365, You should be able to go,,,,
339,366, I don?t know what to do about yours.,,,,
339,365," Oh nothing, wait til they die.",,,,
339,365, Problem solved ,,,,
339,366," Your?s are like so crazy, like, you know definitely putting in a little bit more effort into stalking you and try and mess with things.",,,,
339,365," I don?t know, right now",,,,
339,366, You know your dad goes and impersonates you to get legal documents and shit.,,,,
339,365, I know,,,,
339,366,"  Like, you?ll have to change your social.",,,,
339,365," I want to do it, I want to change my phone number and my social. Um?",,,,
339,366, Yea I do feel like that?s a problem because it?s not your fault your family sucks and that?s obviously a big part of how they get along. ,,,,
339,365," I know, I know that is important to you?",,,,
339,365," To have, like, to have that you know, it was worse while ",,,,
339,366, Yea Yea it?s fine,,,,
339,365, I think it was worse while you were,,,,
339,366, Because I got along really well with like everyone else I dated?s parents.,,,,
339,365," yeah, I just like don?t, you know, I guess there?s nothing I can do at this point it?s just so far beyond saving, like ",,,,
339,366," I mean they don?t do too much crazy shit like, that. Your dad really messed it up that time he pretend to be dead to like scare you . Like to teach you a lesson.  so sad.",,,,
339,365," Yea, yea it?s so shitty, but like in the summer, you know like even though I wasn?t in the hospital, the fact that they thought that I was",,,,
339,366, And acted that way,,,,
339,365, And acted that way was like all...,,,,
339,366, It?s like my cousin telling me that I was going to go to hell.,,,,
339,365, Yea it?s like,,,,
339,366," It doesn?t matter that that doesn?t mean anything to me, like she really believed that. Like, it?s her fault that she thinks that.",,,,
339,365," I mean I feel like, like the fact that my parents are so frank in front of me about like makes me feel like she?s like saw me as like more than",,,,
339,366, Yea Sam is the gatekeeper for sure,,,,
339,365," But that?s what I mean, like she would not have talked that frankly, I don?t know what-",,,,
339,366, Yeah,,,,
339,365," I really like Kelly, I don?t really know Lauren and I?m not really bothered by the fact that she couldn?t remember my name. I really like ",,,,
339,366," She was like ?no no, we haven?t met? and it?s like, there are pictures of you in the same frame.",,,,
339,365, Yeah,,,,
339,366, Eh ,,,,
339,365," Yeah I want to get to know Lindsey, cause like you were saying yesterday, like",,,,
339,366, Yea Lindsey?s cool.,,,,
339,365," And I don?t really know her that well. But again, I-",,,,
339,366, She?s my last fun cousin.,,,,
339,365," But it?s weird, honestly, it?s the same for your cousins, where when I first met them back in like 5 years ago or whatever, I felt like I was like less like when we were going out to the Mexican place I didn?t feel like we were like not on the same status as like Kristen and Robert in terms of like being on equal terms with everyone around the table, you know what I mean? I didn?t feel like we were like ",,,,
339,365, Yea but like they?re more serious but in terms of just like being taken seriously as adults.,,,,
339,366," I think it?s just because Christopher, like, you know now that Christopher and Robby  a baby.",,,,
339,365,yea I don?t,,,,
339,366, We look really adult by comparison,,,,
339,365," Yea, I honestly-",,,,
339,366," But yea, we need to take a special interest in Ollie. ",,,,
339,365, He shouldn?t be living there.,,,,
339,366," I know I want, I want to figure out a way to like give them money that Christopher would accept. Like I could buy him things on Amazon or something.",,,,
339,365, Is he like districted from like a shit school,,,,
339,366, Yes yea like even for Tennessee bad.,,,,
339,365," Wow, I guess is there not like, I guess private schools are expensive",,,,
339,366," Tennessee is better than when I went to school, it was rated like 49th in the country then. ",,,,
339,365, Does Notre Dame have like an elementary school? Like one of those Catholic schools that goes all the way,,,,
339,366," No there?s, there?s feeder schools. Like, there?s St. Jude, which my grammy taught there for a long time. ",,,,
339,365," Like it just seems like he should, like that is so important like",,,,
339,366," Yea, you know why, they probably could if  for like, Christopher could apply for like financial aid, same as like McCaughly or like you. Like a good private school and then, like I could just pay the tuition. But they would give him financial aid.",,,,
339,365,"Well the reason I said is because like studies obviously show that early education is so important, you know-",,,,
339,366, There are a lot of good private schools ,,,,
339,365," Like going to, yea",,,,
339,366, Like in the area,,,,
339,365," Going to like a shit, like a really bad like public, not that",,,,
339,366," Yea I just wish he was zoned, it?s a bad, it?s a bad school.",,,,
339,365, Is it worse than Red Bank?,,,,
339,366," Red Bank?s not that bad, like I-",,,,
339,365, Red Bank used to be like the signal public school. ,,,,
339,366, Well everything went to shit when  yea.,,,,
339,366," Like, um",,,,
339,365, Yea like it?s really important cause I feel like-,,,,
339,366, There?s a lot of museums we could take Oliver to.,,,,
339,365," Yea, I just, I worry about the fourth floor walk up",,,,
339,366, The what?,,,,
339,365," The fourth floor walkup, in ",,,,
339,366," Yea but like, I don?t know. She can deal, I can deal, I had to take Briggs. At first.",,,,
339,365, That?s true.,,,,
339,366,  So like,,,,
339,365," I?m like really having a hard time picturing though right now, I don?t remember just like how much of a-",,,,
339,366,"  Yea I mean, I don?t want to like-",,,,
339,365,"I think Oliver would really benefit going to like, cause it?s really important to like instill that ? oh wait he?s almost a year old. ",,,,
339,366, Yea,,,,
339,365," I don?t know at what age you?re like young enough, I mean old enough to like take in, you know like, at what age would he like get like positive something out of going to the natural history museum and seeing like the dinosaur skeleton.",,,,
339,366," Well he?s obviously not going to remember it, but like exposing him to those things still might, like his personality might build off of that.",,,,
339,365, Yea,,,,
339,366, Even if he doesn?t have the memories.,,,,
339,365,"Cause like I have memories of going to the natural  museum and like, and, like you know, having like really-",,,,
339,366," Yea I think it?d be good for him to hear all of the languages, see a lot of the different people.",,,,
339,365, Yea I didn?t even think about that.,,,,
339,366, Yea that kind of stuff. ,,,,
339,365," Oh my god, yea, the languages, that?s so big. ",,,,
339,365, Just sitting on the subway-,,,,
339,366," I mean, doubt he even hears Spanish.",,,,
339,365,"Really, I thought there was a fair amount of Hispanic people-",,,,
339,366,"Well, it?s just, like a really segregated area, and it?s really not.",,,,
339,365,"Cause in our neighborhood people were talking Spanish so much, it would be so easy-",,,,
339,366, I know that?s great.,,,,

342,371, Then I'm sorry.,,,,
342,372, I don't do it too. I have never done that.,,,,
342,371," Well, they don't go to this school. They're not here all the time but I will say I realized a lot and I'm going to change my perspective. I anything that I have to realize like historical things to to be creative.",,,,
342,372, Exactly. You wouldn't even be able to really talk about someone who doesn't go to this school long time ago. You still get mad. I don't care- that all day.,,,,
342,371, Talk about what all day?,,,,
342,372, You're.,,,,
342,371, Who cares? I don't get what really what this conversation is about. I don't really get this discussion.,,,,
342,372," Well, how can we talk about it without getting mad? I think that was off-key, right?",,,,
342,371," I actually don't- I don't know. I don't think I'm mad. You're all mad. So, it's fine.",,,,
342,372, What do you mean? You do get mad.,,,,
342,371, No. I'm-- ,,,,
342,372, It makes you mad.,,,,
342,371, Why are you saying all these things? ,,,,
342,371," That's true. Yes, you're right.",,,,
342,372, How can we talk about things like that without getting either of us upset?,,,,
342,371," Talk about things like what? Like what they're doing currently in their life? Would you be like, ""Oh.""",,,,
342,372," That's state recognition. It doesn't matter and it's supposed to be. I don't think they'll ever be brought up naturally but if we were to bring it out, how will we bring it up so that it doesn't make either of us mad?",,,,
342,371, Okay. Let me think about that. Maybe you preface it with a trigger warning.,,,,
342,372, Trigger warning . That's really--,,,,
342,371," Then we talk about something that's- hopefully not make-- But here's what I don't like when you do, when you're like, ""I want to tell you something but I know you're going to be so mad."" It's not going to do.",,,,
342,372, Exactly.,,,,
342,371," It's tantalizing. Yes, because it's like you're tantalizing information or something you want to share with me but you don't--",,,,
342,371," You're just like, ""Ah but you're going to be so. I'm afraid of your reaction so I'm not going to tell you,"" but then you end up telling me anyway. I think the preface-- I would prefer if you didn't use that intro to talk about what you think that would make me not.",,,,
342,372, Why 15 minutes.,,,,
342,371," Came around. I think if you were to say something like-- Maybe you just do it really casually just like-- I don't know. I can't even think of why you would say anything to be like, ""Oh, yes. Today we talked about how we book a flight together.""",,,,
342,372, Exactly.,,,,
342,371, I'm not though.,,,,
342,372, You're thinking about a time where you got really mad and you trying to make a joke or you're just getting upset or both.,,,,
342,371," No. I don't think- I'm not getting upset. I'm just saying, in the future, maybe you can just say it casually and say everything that have to give me and I'll be like, ""Cool."" If you're just really honest about all of your interactions and just make it seem normal and not a big deal then maybe I can follow.",,,,
342,372, Okay. I'll try that.,,,,
342,371, Thank you.,,,,
342,372," I'm thinking I was talking about the actual context in which these things get brought up. Well, that's 100% brought up by you.",,,,
342,371,  I don't think so.,,,,
342,372," Most of the time and it's when you're making yourself mad by thinking about something that made you mad a long time ago, so in those situations, what I would try to do is to stay calm. Most of the time I'm just not able to because I'm upset that you're so stubborn about these things so.",,,,
342,371,"I guess I could listen to you more but I imagine in those situations, listen to me more.",,,,
342,371,"  Okay. Obviously, try to think of something you would do. I just think it's funny that you're ranting- it was like that mean. There is some kind of apology there. There's only but then you're like, ""I'm sorry,"" but really it was your fault. Like why would you do this thing? I can't believe that I'm so mad at you. This is. Another thing I would say is, we could talk about what we do in situation when we were confronted with a lot of fear in person. What do we do when I walk into your living space to meet you and I see you there standing right next to her engaging in conversation with her? What do we do in that situation? What could we do better?                 ",,,,
342,372, You could just get involved with the conversation.,,,,
342,371, I was involved because I talked to your friend Lisa.,,,,
342,372, That's.,,,,
342,371," When I get involved, I try not to say hi--",,,,
342,372," Well, then, at what point did you get super mad?",,,,
342,371, Huh?,,,,
342,372, What point did you get super mad? When you walked in or when you--?,,,,
342,371, Immediately.,,,,
342,372, Exactly.,,,,
342,371, But I was talking amazingly. I was controlling myself by being really funny. Didn't you notice that? I was really mad,,,,
342,372, I don't know why you.,,,,
342,371, Do you think I did something wrong in that situation?,,,,
342,372," For the rest of the night, like an hour, you were so obsessed.",,,,
342,371, In the circle.,,,,
342,372," No, but you can't make me feel guilty for the next hour because you were mad when you walked in. She just waited until you talked to the little guy in. I realized I wasn't actually talking to the girl you thought I was talking to and then you went and mad.",,,,
342,371, Or you could have brought your friend to the side and talked to him by yourself.,,,,
342,372, I was to the side.,,,,
342,371, You were not. You were literally in a circle of people from your hometown and both girls and I feel like it was really helpful for me to get into the circle because you made a little clique of people that I hadn't known yet.,,,,
342,372, I could not tell you were like  when there is a party.,,,,
342,371," So? Yes, there will . Why do you make circles?",,,,
342,372, Everybody's going to party. You can just.,,,,
342,371, That's not part of.,,,,
342,372, But I can't be on the side of anything.,,,,
342,371," I was saying maybe next time-- If you really were talking to your friend, you could move to like the refrigerator or something, or the party space is huge. You don't have to be right next to the girl.",,,,
342,372, That's who we came with.,,,,
342,371," Yes, but if you were talking- if there's like- walk away.",,,,
342,372, I should be able to talk to them too if I wanted to and then and you should feel comfortable just joining in if you wanted to.,,,,
342,371, Inserting myself where you didn't even introduce me.,,,,
342,372, I wasn't talking to you.,,,,
342,371," Well, I think I'm still saying that if you were talking to her, even if you were- that's a different situation. The situation we're talking about is that you didn't have interest to talk to her and ended up talking to her so just a little bit is what I thought.",,,,
342,372, Why would I do that when he is- He came with it--,,,,
342,371, Who cares if it's-- ,,,,
342,372, Why would I just-- ,,,,
342,371, I came with we have to speak like we're together.,,,,
342,372, It just doesn't make any sense.,,,,
342,371, I don't care.,,,,
342,372, I don't know. Let's just walk away-- That's for no reason. Let's just walk away.,,,,
342,371," No, it's just a natural drifting.",,,,
342,372," It's not natural. I have to say, ""Okay..""",,,,
342,371, Not pushing.,,,,
342,372, It doesn't make any sense. You know it doesn't make any sense.,,,,
342,371, I think it makes sense. If you're just talking about-- ,,,,
342,372, Why is this a demand that you have?,,,,
342,371, It's not a demand. We're talking about suggestion.,,,,
342,372, This is the reason you got mad. It's not.,,,,
342,371, But I was  suggestions for things to do.,,,,
342,372," No, this is not any sort of factor. You would still get mad.",,,,
342,371, How would I--,,,,
342,372, You walked in and you started anywhere.,,,,
342,371," Yes, I wouldn't have been like, ""Ugh,"" with you but I wouldn't have been like, ""I'm stopping her."" It's totally different.",,,,
342,372, It doesn't really matter if I was.,,,,
342,371," That's what I'm saying, okay? Even if you were I would still be--",,,,
342,372, It's so.,,,,
342,371," I know but it's just I don't like seeing her. I know you can do whatever you want but I can just be annoyed, for a little bit, if you really care.",,,,
342,372," Okay, then eventually I won't care that you're annoyed.",,,,
342,371," Okay, then don't care anymore. I guess it's what's going to happen.",,,,
342,372, You want that to happen? Or do you want to stop feeling annoyed?,,,,
342,371, I do want to stop feeling annoyed but I don't really know how.,,,,
342,372, Anyway.,,,,
342,371, It would all be easier if she wasn't such a rude person.,,,,
342,372, You don't know her at all.,,,,
342,371, Well she completely ignores me every single time we've ever had an interaction.,,,,
342,372, It's only been twice.,,,,
342,371, It's like 30.,,,,
342,372, I think we're done. So close. ,,,,
342,371, You don't want to ,,,,
342,372, No.,,,,
342,371, Please.,,,,
342,371, That was one thing I wrote down too. I just.,,,,
342,372, Seriously?,,,,
342,371, It's fun.,,,,
342,372, That was one of the questions that ,,,,
342,371," I just wish that you could just-- Yes, I have to but if I just want to roll my eyes, I'll just be like--",,,,
342,372, That's not a reason.,,,,
342,371," I was like, ""Ugh."" This isn't.",,,,
342,372, You took me to the side and you--,,,,
342,371, I took you to the side? I thought we were not allowed to take people to the side in parties?,,,,
342,372," No, I came over when you were visibly upset. I don't know why you.",,,,
342,372, Open the door.,,,,
342,371, What part were you talking about that got me on the edge of my seat? What part were you talking about? I don't even remember.,,,,
342,372, I have no idea.,,,,
343,374, What are we talking about? ,,,,
343,373,"  Hey, you don?t pay attention. It?s very important to-",,,,
343,374," Okay, what are we talking abou-",,,,
343,373," It?s like, uh, what each of us, uh, give up-",,,,
343,374," Oh, yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,373, in a relationship and stuff.,,,,
343,374, That?s what we?re talking about now?,,,,
343,373," Yeah  because we had to do that thing about why it?s important to talk about it, and then we have to talk about it.",,,,
343,374,"  Mm, okay. Yeah. K.",,,,
343,373, I think that?s the question. ,,,,
343,374, Okay. I want you to go first.,,,,
343,373," Well, I think that I haven?t gived up, given up?GIVEN up like enough in the relationship in the past and I?m really trying to get it to a place, at least now, with like, being a priority in my life. Where it--at least make you feel like I?m doing more, I?m doing more sacrifices. And we have fifteen minutes, and I might as well elaborate. ",,,,
343,374,  Sure.,,,,
343,373," Well like, I know--",,,,
343,374, You don?t have to. You-you don?t have to. We could just talk about it.,,,,
343,373,"  Yeah, I guess. But like, just like, I don?t know, especially about moving away for work. And, like, life stuff and always putting like jobs and stuff, I guess as the priority instead of physical closeness in the relationship. ",,,,
343,373, Which is obviously-,,,,
343,374, You gotta speak up for them.,,,,
343,373," Yeah. Which is obviously  like uh, it?s been a big issue, and um, ",,,,
343,374, Mhmm.,,,,
343,373," And?and so I feel like, if we?re talking about-- I mean, if it?s a conversation about? I don?t know. I--there are things I think I have given up obviously. ",,,,
343,374, Mhmm ,,,,
343,373," But I think that like, when you?re comparing what you gave up versus what I?ve given up, I don?t even think it?s worth like, raising. You know what I mean? It?s not even like-",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, I don?t know. It?s insignificant in comparison.,,,,
343,374, Mhmm  ,,,,
343,373, That?s my answer.,,,,
343,374," Yeah. I guess, uh, my like, short answer to start with is that I guess that we?ve both given up to, like, whatever, a certain degree. Small degree to large degree. Whatever. But like it doesn?t. It?s not what it sounds like. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," But what we give up is like a certain amount of like, happiness in the moment because you?re not feeling? yeah I don?t know. Like, you?re, you?re not happy--The other person is not happy with how the situation is-",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," a hundred percent. So even if you?re like, ninety nine percent happy, you?re still giving up, like that one percent of happiness  because either of how you expect it to be, or how you want it to be. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374, Or just what you?ve always wanted. ,,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374, And it?s not going to be that way. ,,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," So like, whatever percentage that happens to be of your overall happiness, that?s what you give up. ",,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374, And I think it shifts from time to time. ,,,,
343,373, ,,,,
343,374," Like at certain points in the relationship, somebody is giving up more than somebody else. ",,,,
343,373, ,,,,
343,374," And then, at other points in the relationship-- But I think that?s what it boils down to. I think maybe if they?re looking for like concrete answers, or whatever, it?s like sometimes I don?t know?at some point in this relationship I was giving up, like, yeah like, having-having you physically close to me.",,,,
343,373,  Mmm.,,,,
343,374,  Missing like physical intimacy.,,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374,"  And, giving up a feeling, personal feeling of like safety and security within the relationship by not feeling like you were prioritizing things sometimes. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373," Not to like, what it probably like would normally feel to actually have a girlfriend. Like that?s not, like obviously",,,,
343,374, Uh-huh,,,,
343,373, and not somebody who?s miles away that you only talk to on skype or whatever. ,,,,
343,374," Yeah. And I?I don?t know. For you, I feel like I, I don?t know, you probably gave up some sort of like, expectations.",,,,
343,373," I think, I mean, part of it is like expectations. And that stuff I don?t even hold on to or care about because I think there are some things that both of us give up that?s like, it was like a problematic expectation in the first place. ",,,,
343,373," And like, by giving it up you realize that, like, you thinking that way probably wasn?t right to begin with. Like it?s? I don?t know. Do you know what I mean?",,,,
343,374, I know what you mean.,,,,
343,373, Like- ,,,,
343,374, Yeah- ,,,,
343,373," Like there are things that I, in the past maybe expected and then feel like I gave up at that time.",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm,,,,
343,373," Because I, because it was never going to be the way I that I expected. But I realized that the way that I expected things to be, like, just weren?t? like, it just-- like it was just stupid.",,,,
343,374, It was unrealistic,,,,
343,373," Yeah. It was not only unrealistic. It was just stupid. It was, like an expectation that was put into me by like, the way that I was raised, or like, the people that I surrounded myself with, or whatever. ",,,,
343,374,  Mmm.,,,,
343,373," And it wasn?t actually an expectation that was like, based in logic and how the world really is, and--",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,373," And I don?t know. And like, what our relationship, I guess. So that stuff I don?t really care.",,,,
343,374," I feel like that answer, like, is the exact same for me too.",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374," Cause it?s like whatever, I gave up certain expectations ] of something too. And it was ",,,,
343,373,  Yeah. ,,,,
343,374, Yeah. So I feel like we have similar answers. ,,,,
343,373, Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," But I feel like yeah, it?s the same, but it?s just different things. Whereas, like, this is just, like, just something random like? I think in the past, like years and years ago, there are certain situations where, like, you would have just, maybe not expected, but, like, have preferred or, like, had not agreed with, if I, if I didn?t remain passive in that situation. ",,,,
343,373, Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," Whereas, like, these days, maybe that you?ve seen that there are some situations that you just shouldn?t stay passive in. ",,,,
343,373,"   Yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,374, And like-,,,,
343,373,  Yeah. ,,,,
343,374," in the beginning, where I was not staying passive in those situations, you?d get upset at me.",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374,"  And just be like why, why are you rocking the boat.",,,,
343,373,"  yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,374," Or like, why are you doing whatever.",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374,"  But I feel like now, nowadays you see-",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374,  that maybe rocking the boat sometimes is needed when you feel like something is-,,,,
343,373, Yeah. It?s better to get it off your chest I guess.,,,,
343,374," Yeah, yeah. Or, or you feel like you?re being treated unfairly or something.",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm. Mmmm.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373," Yeah. Oh yeah.  I mean yeah, for sure. ",,,,
343,374," Like, out in the world, or whatever. ",,,,
343,373,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,374, Not necessarily in the relationship-,,,,
343,373, Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," But like, if I were to rock the boat with somebody else you might be like, why?",,,,
343,373, Yeah. But then you?re like? yeah.,,,,
343,374, Yeah. But then after you rock the boat you make like five thousand dollars more a year.,,,,
343,373, Yeah,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374, Yeah. So I don?t know-,,,,
343,374,"  I feel like there?s, there, but yeah-- there but those are like also, just different expectations. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374," Like? I don?t know what else. I-I feel like, having had problems in the past, like, and then when you get over them? it feels like you?re giving up something in the moment; I guess it always feels like you are giving up something big-",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374," Because, I don?t know, you?re continually living in the present. So, like, it feels like the present is bad. But then I guess the longer you go into the relationship, when you look back on it, it feels like, I don?t know, with the bigger picture you can see like, you weren?t giving up like everything-",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374," You were just giving up, I don?t know, whatever it was in the moment-",,,,
343,373, Mmm.,,,,
343,374, to ultimately make you and me work.,,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374,  yeah.,,,,
343,373," And that?s also like, realizing that the person you?re with is never gonna be you. ",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, They?re never gonna function the way you do. ,,,,
343,374,  Of course.,,,,
343,373," And you have to just respect their, I don?t know,",,,,
343,374,  Yeah.,,,,
343,373," their own way of doing things. And like, if you don?t, then you don?t stay together. But if you do,",,,,
343,374,  yeah,,,,
343,373," like we do, then I don?t know. And obviously we were together when we were, well, fairly young. ",,,,
343,374,  Yeah.,,,,
343,373, We started a really serious relationship- ,,,,
343,374,  Mmm.,,,,
343,373, when we were younger- ,,,,
343,374,  yeah.,,,,
343,373," So like, there?s a lot of like immaturity-",,,,
343,374,  yeah.,,,,
343,373,  and a lot of life lessons- ,,,,
343,374,"  yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,374," that you would normally make like, either alone, or with a boyfriend that like you, or girlfriend or whatever that you would eventually break up with in like a year or two.  ",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm. Yeah,,,,
343,373," Making it with a long-time partner, so there?s a lot of like-",,,,
343,374,  yeah.,,,,
343,373, history.,,,,
343,374," Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, when something big happens, it?s like, or when, I don?t know, the first-- something happens for the first time",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374," Then it?s like, yeah. I guess it?s, yeah, it?s different. Then we deal with it.",,,,
343,373,  On and on. For the next nine years.,,,,
343,374,Yeah.,,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,373,"I don?t know. I mean, I think, I mean I do acknowledge that, like, I don?t know, there have been times where like the relationship was really uneven, like, in terms of how much emotionally is being contributed.",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,373,"  Like, and like that?s, I think that the relationship is getting better because I?ve realized that.",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,373,"  And before when I was like, man  I don?t understand why can?t I just do my own thing, because I thought that that was, like, whatever was okay, and was what, I don?t know. Do you know what I mean?",,,,
343,374, I know what you mean.,,,,
343,373, Like-,,,,
343,374," It seems like, to me, that seems like it?s still not how I feel.",,,,
343,373, Mhmm.,,,,
343,374, Right now.,,,,
343,373, Yeah. What do you feel right now?,,,,
343,374," I don?t think you were just like, oh why can?t I just do my own thing. I think you just--",,,,
343,373," No, I mean, like-",,,,
343,374, Didn?t care.,,,,
343,373," Well, I don?t think I never cared. I just think that like, I was always just like, like, in the back of my head, I was like, what-- I don?t know, like, I don?t know",,,,
343,374, That?s all I thought Yeah. Yeah.,,,,
343,374," So yeah, I don?t know. But, to the discussion at hand, that?s what I think-- I don?t know. I think you give up some sort of in-the-present, maybe short-term, but it feels like everything, emotion, positivity, and like, a small amount of happiness, or what feels like a large amount of happiness in the moment. Yeah. Sometimes it?s like that. Sometimes it?s, sometimes you give up nothing. I mean, sometimes it?s like, insignificant stuff. Sometimes it?s like, I give up seconds of my life to clean up a bowl after you-",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374, but it?s not that big of a deal.,,,,
343,373,  Yeah,,,,
343,374," Yeah. Like, it?s just small stuff too. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," But I guess it?s always?and I guess at some point when I clean up enough bowls and you clean up enough bowls after me, I?m sure it doesn?t even matter. So it doesn?t feel like that anymore. But maybe initially it feels like you have to give something up. Even if it?s just like that, I don?t know, you have to give up like, a certain amount of time to like, a moment of frustration because you?re like ah, he left pee on the toilet again. ",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374," Yeah. And then I don?t know, I get it. I don?t do that anymore.",,,,
343,374, But-,,,,
343,373, But I don?t never really feel like I?m giving anything up in that moment. ,,,,
343,374," But I, I don?t know. That why I feel like it can still pertain to the question. ",,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374," Like, you?re giving up that-Like, you tolerate it",,,,
343,373,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for a second of your day.",,,,
343,374, For the relationship to work.,,,,
343,374," Yeah. Either, like, you?re not happy with it, like, that?s something that  don?t know.",,,,
343,373," I don?t think for me there are many things that I like, there are not many seconds that I have to tolerate things",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, I don?t know.,,,,
343,374," I agree. I feel like it?s much less for both of us, than it previously was. ",,,,
343,374," Yeah. Mhmm.  Yeah. To be honest, I don?t know. Do you have anything else to say? Like-",,,,
343,373, Not really. ,,,,
343,374, Yeah. So what?s like--can we get like a concluding statement from you?,,,,
343,373, Concluding statement? ,,,,
343,374, Yeah. That?s just- ,,,,
343,373, I don?t know,,,,
343,374," you know, reiterates and sums up these feelings.",,,,
343,373, I think-,,,,
343,373," I mean, I just, like-",,,,
343,374," Or, or, that pertains, something that pertains like directly to the question. Which is, I don?t know, why, what , like what do you think you give up for the relationship to work? Or something like that? ",,,,
343,373, Yeah. I mean-,,,,
343,374, I don?t really know what the question was.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, It?s kinda gone,,,,
343,374, Mhmm.,,,,
343,373," But-I don?t know. I mean, I feel like just echoing everything that?s already been said. Like, you know, there?s thing that are like, a lot of whatever. You give up at least, at least, like, based on this conversation it feels like it falls into a few categories.",,,,
343,374,Mhmm.,,,,
343,373," The first, are things that are actually really important to you and will always be important to you. ",,,,
343,343, Yeah.,,,,
343,373," It?s not just an expectation that?s, you know, problematic. ",,,,
343,374, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,373, Those things-,,,,
343,373," are important to you and I feel like we?ve- maybe you to a greater degree and me to a lesser degree, have given up those things, and now I wanna get to a place where we?re evening the playing field so that, you know, you don?t feel like you?re the only person that?s giving up things that you really, really care about-",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373,  And will always care about.,,,,
343,374,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,373, I want-,,,,
343,374,"  of course, of course.",,,,
343,373, I wanna also be getting to a point-,,,,
343,374,Mhmm.,,,,
343,373,  where I show you that I?m willing and able to-,,,,
343,374,  Yeah.,,,,
343,373, give up things that I really care about when it comes to the relationship and making you happy. ,,,,
343,374,  Yeah.,,,,
343,373," And then there?s the other category of things that, like, we give up that are based on, like, expectations.",,,,
343,374,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,373,"  On how we think our lives should be, or what the relationship should look like, based on how we were raised and also, like, expectations of us growing up",,,,
343,374, Mhmm,,,,
343,373,"  And expectations that we were told were normal by our families, and communities, and whatever.",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373," And I think, in that, for me at least, I feel like I?ve, uh, like kinda gotten over a lot of those things. And I don?t really see them as things that I?ve given up. I just see them, like, I?m able now to reflect on them, and be like, yeah they?re not actually?they weren?t like, maybe then I was like, oh I?m giving up something up that?s important to me. But now I?m like, ah that isn?t actually important to me. ",,,,
343,374, Mhmm.,,,,
343,373," Like, it should never been important to me to begin with. And then the small things that I guess you give up every second. I don?t know. They?re just there. They?re just-",,,,
343,374," Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,373, They don?t really affect my emotional well-being or anything. So--,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, That?s what I would summarize my perspective as.,,,,
343,374," Yeah, yeah. To give like a?yeah, I basically agree with that. And just another type of like, summary is like, yeah, you?re giving up something, whether it be like the small seconds of the day, ",,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,373, or something big that you feel like you?re giving up. I don?t know. Maybe in the moment you don?t even know if it feels like it?s worth it.,,,,
343,373, Mmm. ,,,,
343,374,"  Or not. Or anything. But you still do it though, you still give that for the hopes of a continued relationship because it?s, ",,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374," I guess it?s something that you want, ",,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374, So you?re willing to give it up. ,,,,
343,374," But then. I mean, I don?t think it should necessarily be that way. You shouldn?t have to, you shouldn?t have to give things up but I also think it?s unrealistic to expect that you?re not going to give things up. ",,,,
343,373, Yeah. Mhmm  ,,,,
343,374, Like it is give and take.,,,,
343,373, Yeah,,,,
343,374, Yeah. It just can't be too much give and too much take.,,,,
343,373," Yeah, exactly.",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373, It should be equal. I guess-,,,,
343,374," Or it should just be, like, whatever, at a equilibrium- ",,,,
343,373, At different times-,,,,
343,374," The partners?not even at?yeah, I guess it can be at different times. ",,,,
343,373, Yeah.,,,,
343,374," But like, an emotional equilibrium, where both of the partners feel okay with, you know?",,,,
343,373,  Mhmm.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,374," There might be a period of time where somebody is working a lot and the other person is not, they?re just not around or something-",,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374," And like for that, for whatever period of time, if it?s a week or a month or whatever, I mean it could just be that like, both the partners are like happy with it. Like, oh yeah, like I see that they?re, like they have to work a lot, like-",,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374, So when they come home I?m happy and this and that. ,,,,
343,373, Mhmm. ,,,,
343,374, But like I understand that they?re just working a lot this month or whatever to make it happen. ,,,,
343,373, Mhmm. Yeah. ,,,,
343,374, Whereas-,,,,
343,373," But the hope is that, that that isn?t, like, obviously every month. That this is, there?s an unequal balance-",,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
343,373,  This month-,,,,
343,374," Yeah, yeah.",,,,
343,373, But next month they pull their weight.,,,,
343,374," Yeah. I think you either have to just know that there?s going to be the inequality sometimes, where like... ",,,,
343,373, Mmmm. ,,,,
343,374," You?re giving up something whether that?s like, the presence of your spouse or something, for them to do something",,,,
343,373, Mhmm ,,,,
343,374," Or, there?s an unequal balance where it?s like you are, you?re taking a lot but you hope that there?s the expectation that you can even give back in the future to make like--",,,,
343,373,  Yeah.,,,,
343,374, Yeah.,,,,
344,376, Let?s talk about it again.,,,,
344,376," So, let me see your hair.",,,,
344,375, Ohh,,,,
344,376, Looks so pretty.,,,,
344,376," So, um?",,,,
344,375, So what did you put?,,,,
344,376," Don?t worry about that. We?re gonna talk about our discussion on what, how we, how we work things out. So-",,,,
344,375," Yeah., that?s why we put it there. Right?",,,,
344,376, K. Need pillow?,,,,
344,375,  I do actually. A little bit. So?,,,,
344,376," So how do you feel about, um-",,,,
344,375, How do you-,,,,
344,376," When we, when we get in-",,,,
344,375,"No, no. How did you feel about what you wrote? That?s what we were gonna talk about it.",,,,
344,376,Is that what we?re talking about?,,,,
344,375, Yeah.,,,,
344,376,  I actually like-- I like what I wrote.,,,,
344,375, Mhmm. ,,,,
344,376, It?s really cool.,,,,
344,375, Mhmm.,,,,
344,376," It?s uh?I put on the boxes, I put",,,,
344,375, Mhmm ,,,,
344,376," Then I put, um, listening",,,,
344,375, Mhmm. ,,,,
344,376, To what you have to say. Then at the bottom I said I agree with everything.,,,,
344,376,  Because-,,,,
344,376," Well, cause you annoy me sometimes, but that?s okay.",,,,
344,375,"  But we talk about it, and?",,,,
344,376," We talk about it after, we laugh about it.",,,,
344,375, Uh-huh,,,,
344,376, Right after we?re done disagreeing about it we laugh.,,,,
344,375, Mhmm,,,,
344,376," If I get mad at you, you get mad at me, we laugh all the time.",,,,
344,375, Mhmm.,,,,
344,376,"I just, uh,",,,,
344,375," Oh, I didn?t-I didn?t even put  I just talk and talk and talk. ",,,,
344,376,  That?s what you do.,,,,
344,375,  Ow. I forgot to put that?Maybe I guess I need to listen more.,,,,
344,376,"  There ya go. We?ll get something outta this, it?ll be awesome. Better our relationship all the way through.",,,,
344,376, It?s so fun.,,,,
344,375,  I need to tell you all the time. ,,,,

345,378," So, jealousy. ",,,,
345,377," So, jealousy.",,,,
345,378, Are you ever jealous?,,,,
345,377, Am I ever jealous? I do tend to get jealous-,,,,
345,377, Every once in a while. ,,,,
345,378, Give me an example.,,,,
345,377," Um, I was jealous, um, two nights ago when we went to---There was a moment when you were like, touching Rachel?s hand.",,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377," And I was like, great, well I?m gonna leave from here. Drive home by myself.   Have fun sleeping somewhere else tonight. ",,,,
345,377, And I haven?t told you that yet.,,,,
345,378, Mmm. Thanks for telling me.,,,,
345,377," Cause it just felt like a stupid moment. Like, a moment where I was just like, I can just choose not to be jealous about this and its petty.",,,,
345,378, Did you choose not to be jealous?,,,,
345,377," I mean, I can?t really choose not be jealous-",,,,
345,377, I can pretend that I can choose not to be jealous. That?s fun.,,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377, But it doesn?t quite work. ,,,,
345,377, So that was last time I felt jealous.,,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377, Yeah.,,,,
345,378, What did it feel like?,,,,
345,377, Um?Like I wish that I hadn?t seen it.,,,,
345,378, Hmm.,,,,
345,377," Like, I just like, looked over?I was talking to Marcus, and another kid whose mouth was blue from the candy-",,,,
345,377," Um, and I just like looked over, and from like the side of my eye saw that. And I was like, damn it. It could have been so easy for me to just not see that.  And then I was like, well I can just pretend I didn?t see it-",,,,
345,377, Cause it would have been really easy for me to just not see it.,,,,
345,378, I didn?t even know that that happened.,,,,
345,377,Exactly.,,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377,  Yeah.,,,,
345,378,  Mmm.,,,,
345,378, Jealousy.,,,,
345,377,  Jealousy. That?s?,,,,
345,377, Do you know what that remind me of?,,,,
345,378, Improv?,,,,
345,377,Yeah.,,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,377," Yup. Um, the, the thing that?s relevant to share about what Jen and John do in their relationship is that every morning they wake up, and they set a container for the day. So they?ll be like, do you want to play today? And then they each say yes or no. And if they both say yes then they?re like opting in to being present in the relationship for the day.",,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377, Isn?t that cool?,,,,
345,378, It is. What does that mean?,,,,
345,377," Um, I don?t know. I can ask her more about it. But I think I wanna do it together.",,,,
345,378, Interesting.,,,,
345,377," Cause it reminds me of like, what I just wrote, about like, making sure that we like, opt in to conversations about jealousy so that it feels good.",,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377, And that we set like a time frame-,,,,
345,378, Mhmm,,,,
345,377," And like-  a container. Yeah. So anyway, jealousy.",,,,
345,378,Oooo.,,,,
345,378, Umm?,,,,
345,377, When was the last time you were jealous?,,,,
345,378, I?m thinking.,,,,
345,377, Oh-,,,,
345,378," Oh, ooo, I know. The last time I felt jealous when I accidentally like peeked over at your phone when you were in WhatsApp and saw that you had a new message from Ethan.",,,,
345,378," And I was like, great, they?re, they?re talking. Like, one on one. that?s great. That?s great. I?m just gonna, just gonna, not say anything about it. Just like, I?ll just be good. I?ll just be fine.",,,,
345,377,It?s the same thing. We?re so funny.,,,,
345,378,  Cause it would be so petty to like tell you I?m feeling jealous about something that?s like is so insignificant like that.,,,,
345,377, Right. You could have not touched her hand.,,,,
345,378, yeah. You could have just not talked to him ever.,,,,
345,377, Right. Exactly. Like never.,,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,377, So what did you do with that feeling?,,,,
345,378, I just like?my heart started pounding a little faster-,,,,
345,378," And then I just like, like got a little tight, and like looked away and like-",,,,
345,378, Retreated a little bit in the conversation.,,,,
345,378, You didn?t notice?or you probably did notice and didn?t say anything.,,,,
345,377, When was it?,,,,
345,378," Um, we were on the couch. I think before?I think this was yesterday.",,,,
345,378," Or, two days ago. But like, within the past couple of days. And, yeah. I just keep going to this weird place of like, God I love him, like, God, I hate him.",,,,
345,377, right. Yeah.,,,,
345,378," Just, um, stop talking to men who want you.",,,,
345,378, And then we?ll be fine.,,,,
345,377, That?s easy.,,,,
345,378, Only talk to men who don?t want you.,,,,
345,377, Perfect.,,,,
345,378," And by that I mean, don?t talk to men.",,,,
345,377," I?ll never talk to another man again, except for you.",,,,
345,378, Or women.,,,,
345,377, Or women. I?ll never talk to anyone?,,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,377, Ever again.,,,,
345,378," Like, what else do you need that I don?t give you?",,,,
345,377,  Exactly.,,,,
345,377," Um, yeah. Ethan and I have been trying to find a time to do desire pulling. Um, which is kind of fun.",,,,
345,378, I hate that.,,,,
345,377," I know.  It hasn?t happened, for one reason or another, and cause I?I feel kinda weird about using desire pulling as like a way to like, talk about the fact that he said, that he shared with me that he wants to have sex with me. But really, like we?re trying to like, communicate with each other, but we?re like, let?s do desire pulling. And I want?",,,,
345,378, Like you both know what you?re doing.,,,,
345,377," Yeah. And so I think the reason it hasn?t happened is because I personally don?t feel totally integrity with, like the container of desire pulling.",,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377," But, um, but it feels fun to be messaging him. But also, it?s just like, scheduling a time for something that hasn?t happened, so, I guess there?s just",Like some like?I feel like I should be defining my- ,,,
345,378, I was just thinking the same thing.,,,,
345,377," Like, my like, unpotentiated, like, like the sexual energy. Yeah. Yeah that was for the cameras.",,,,
345,378,"Sup, guys? ",,,,
345,377,What?s up guys? ,,,,
345,378," Uhhh, when was another time you felt jealous?",,,,
345,377,"Oh my god, I hate this one.",,,,
345,378, Oooo.,,,,
345,377, It?s so stupid. It doesn?t even make sense.,,,,
345,378, Oh good.,,,,
345,377," Oh. Well, now I have two. When you said that you were attracted to Alexia, I went and then had a dream that I was like, telling off this woman that you wanted to have sex with?",,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377," Which was Stella in my dream. I was like, don?t fucking talk to me about Stella, Zach. Stella, aka, Alexia.",,,,
345,378, AKA your demon.,,,,
345,377, AKA my demon. Um?,,,,
345,378,Her shadow side.,,,,
345,377,"My shadow side. Um, yeah. That sucked.  That was a shitty feeling. I was like, okay we?re in this really soft spot about jealousy right now, like, great. Good thing you?re telling me that you?re attracted to the woman you?re sitting next to, like, thanks a lot for that one. Felt like? I don?t know. I guess it just hurt my feelings because I was like, feeling insecure already, and you knew that, and then?and then you said that anyway.",,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377," And I guess like, saying it again now I?m grateful for it cause I know it?s something that you don?t always share with me-",,,,
345,377," Like, the desires that you have.",,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377," And I guess it feels good to feel you there. And also, I have this like burning in my stomach, that?s like, no!  He shouldn?t tell you that, and he should you better. But it was a personal problem.  And then, I was jealous at healing chorus, um, because you were sitting next to?I don?t even know her name. With the bangs. The cute one. With the short hair who has the boyfriend.",,,,
345,378," Oh, um, um, Chelsea.",,,,
345,377, Chelsea.,,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,377," Yeah, you were sitting next to her. And I guess that I thought she was cute, and so I was like, Zach?s gonna think she?s cute, cause I-",,,,
345,378, Oh yeah. I am attracted to her.,,,,
345,377, Exactly. Now I wanna kill you.  Yeah.,,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,377, Yeah.,,,,
345,378, And I?,,,,
345,377," But then I felt better?See how I don?t even want you to talk. I?m just gonna keep talking  because I don?t wanna hear it. I felt better after the other day when you were like, yeah, whenever I?m attracted to a woman, I always tell you about her after, but I don?t say it. And it was like, he didn?t tell me about Chelsea after healing chorus. Score.",,,,
345,377, So?,,,,
345,378," Yeah. That one I didn?t tell about because like, it was more serious. Not like serious, serious. But like, I was like, I?m like actually attracted to her.",,,,
345,377, I hate that.,,,,
345,378," And Alexia was more just like, eh, she?s cute.",,,,
345,377,"I hate that. You know it was really cause I was attracted to her, right?",,,,
345,378, Really?,,,,
345,378, Do you think that actually is why that happens?,,,,
345,377, Yes.,,,,
345,378, Hmmm.,,,,
345,377, Yes. I totally do.,,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377,"  Like, when I was like, wow I love Emily. I think she?s so cool. And I was like, you should go connect with Emily. ",,,,
345,378, That was really funny.,,,,
345,377," That was really funny. I-I have to tell her that someday. Cause now I like, love her and we?re gonna watch This Is Us together",,,,
345,378, ,,,,
345,377, But you?ve seen her clitoris?So that?s weird.,,,,
345,378, Is it?,,,,
345,377,  I don?t know. I?,,,,
345,378, I mean like---does that mean I can?t be friends with Jamie?,,,,
345,377, I haven?t seen Jamie?Jamie?s clitoris ,,,,
345,378, You know what I mean.,,,,
345,377, Umm.Jamie?s seen my clitoris?Ehhh ,,,,
345,377, Ummm?.umm,,,,
345,378," Remember the question like, do you and your partner laugh together?",,,,
345,377, No.,,,,
345,377, We never laugh.,,,,
345,378, We--,,,,
345,378, We?re very stoic people.,,,,
345,377, We?ve never laughed about?that?s a terrifying face you just made.,,,,
345,377," Went it was like, does your b?do you run out of things to talk about, I was like-",,,,
345,378,  No.,,,,
345,377," What do you mean?  Anyway, ummm, jealousy.",,,,
345,378,  Jealousy.,,,,
345,377, I like your bright green socks.,,,,
345,378, Thank you. I got them for free.,,,,
345,377," Oh yeah, I remember that.",,,,
345,377, So jealousy.,,,,
345,377, I think I?m not jealous anymore.,,,,
345,378, Sounds right.,,,,
345,377,I hope you never talk to Chelsea again. ,,,,
345,377,  I hope you never see her again.,,,,
345,377," Eww, that?s disgusting.",,,,
345,378, It sure is.,,,,
345,377, You know what?,,,,
345,378, Chelsea was?can I?,,,,
345,377, Yes.,,,,
345,378," Chelsea, umm, last immersion, was?",,,,

345,378, No. She showed up for one day to visit.,,,,
345,377,"Oh, that was her. ",,,,
345,378, Yeah. I didn?t recognize her at first.,,,,
345,377, I wasn?t attracted to her then.,,,,
345,378, Me neither.,,,,
345,378, I didn?t recognize her either.,,,,
345,377, That?s what I?m saying.,,,,
345,378," But like when I got to um, healing chorus, she was like, oh yeah, like, I came to your potlunch. I was like, oh that was you. Why don?t I remember you?",,,,
345,378, Umm?Anyways--,,,,
345,377, Cause I wasn?t attracted to her yet.,,,,
345,378," That?s funny. Umm, yeah she was there, like at that pot lunch that I was just like, handling everything.",,,,
345,377, Mmmm.,,,,
345,378," Until like when was just like, oh yeah like, now she knows like, like I?m a boss.",,,,
345,377, She also knows your girlfriend?s crazy.,,,,

345,377," Um, because I cried all weekend.",,,,
345,378," True, yeah.",,,,
345,377," Yeah, I?m pretty sure?this is just lucky for me?that nobody in that room is ever going to date either one of us.  And maybe that?s a fear. ",,,,
345,378, Mmm.,,,,
345,377,   I?m pretty sure I ruined it for both of us.,,,,
345,378," It?s okay. I don?t really, not really attracted to her.",,,,
345,377, You don?t really like her?,,,,
345,378," No, that?s not what I said.",,,,

345,377," It was the only thing I could think of cause you already decided that gluten allergies are real, so knocking  that of the list we?re just down to ghosts. ",,,,
345,378, I got ghosts. ,,,,
345,377, I got ghosts. ,,,,

345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377," For how we?re going to move forward and being with other people, and what that?s going to look like. Truthfully, I think we should do that, I think we should do that like tomorrow, like way before the immersions so we have a few days to think about it, and change the rules or whatever.",,,,
345,378, Mhmm.,,,,
345,377," Not saying that either one of us is going to do anything during the immersion, but clearly that?s also where my brain was. So. Although Ethan?s not staying with us anymore?That?d be complicated if he was?.Also, I might be sick. You might have gotten me sick enough that I can?t have sex with anyone.",,,,
345,378, But you?re going to anyways.,,,,
345,377, Was that your goal?,,,,
345,377, I don?t know. If you ever talk to Chelsea again I?ll kill you. ,,,,
345,378," I think it?s funny how jealous you get, and just like, how like, completely irrational you are.",,,,
345,377,  I know.,,,,
345,377, I?m sweating.  I smell my deodorant right now.,,,,
345,378," Like, you?re just always like, wow like, I?m jealous and therefore like, uh, he should die. ",,,,
345,377,"  Yeah, you?re right. All of the women who I?m friends with know that I wanna set your bed on fire.",,,,
345,377, Like they know that that?s my go to. Like I?m gonna set his bed on fire.,,,,
345,378, Where are you gonna sleep?,,,,
345,377,  In my cold room all alone.,,,,
345,377, Which is where I?m sleeping anyway cause you?re coughing.,,,,
345,377," Jealousy.  Ummm, oh these are angled like this so we get like, each of our faces, so they can like, look at our faces.",,,,
345,378, Yeah.,,,,
345,378, We?ve got nice faces to look at.,,,,
345,377," That?s true.  Um, jealousy.",,,,
345,378," Yeah, you?re?.yeah, you?re wild.",,,,
345,377," I just remembered that I really like giving you hickies because then other women know that you?re mine.  I?m gonna gi?I?m not gonna tell you my plan actually. I mean, I just told you, but.",,,,
345,378, Is i?Is it that you?re gonna give me hickies so that you can claim me?,,,,
345,377,Yes.,,,,
345,377,  How?d you figure it out?,,,,
345,378,"Well, you know, just my incredible deductive reasoning.",,,,
345,377, Shit.,,,,
345,378, Just call me Sherlock Holmes.,,,,
345,377, I will not do that because then I won?t wanna have sex with you. And neither will they.,,,,
345,378," Yeah, they already don?t.",,,,
345,377," That?s not even true. Yeah, well. That?s not even true. Gabby wanted to have sex with you. There was a part of me that?s really glad that she?s not in the community, the CP community anymore, so that we don?t have to talk about having a threesome with her anymore.",,,,
345,378," Yeah, I never really wanted that.",,,,
345,377," Yeah, I agree. I don?t know if it?s cause I didn?t want it, or cause it scared me. But I think I actually wasn?t that turned on by it. Maybe we kicked her out of the community. Maybe we planted the seed in her brain, like, ?leave. It?s hard for us.?",,,,
345,378," Hmm. I mean, I was just always kinda weirded out by her.",,,,
345,377," God, there?s this weird like, misogynistic part of me that?s like  yes. It?s really hard.",,,,
345,377, it?s really hard to like be friends with women who wanna have sex with you Truthfully what I think that you could feel-,,,,
350,387, Alright so which family do you want to start with? ,,,,
350,388,"  I mean like, bold claim but I think, I feel like there are fewer issues, sources of contention, when we?re talking about my family as opposed to yours, correct me if I?m wrong.",,,,
350,387,well that?s we bury a lot of the stuff that?s about your family.,,,,
350,388, Ok,,,,
350,387, Because of the other connections.,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, Like I would like to talk more about your relationship with Kate.,,,,
350,388, Well yea,,,,
350,387, Cause that?s difficult,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, Because that?s important to understanding your relationship with her and the rest of the family dynamics.,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," And we never get to talk about that, because it?s very sensitive and painful for you.",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," So so so, that that that being said",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," But, yes, but like in terms of",,,,
350,387," In terms of like immediate tangible issues, yea there?s more on my parents? side.",,,,
350,388, I mean you gotta-,,,,
350,387," Them, them are difficult.",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,388," Cool, so",,,,
350,387," Yea, so we we can start there, like that makes sense",,,,
350,388," I mean, it can be free flowing",,,,
350,387," Yes, alright, deal",,,,
350,387," Yea, um",,,,
350,388," Well so one of, one of the main issues that, you know, that I have is I feel like they have too much control over you.",,,,
350,388," And that they are, you know, a little too helicopter-y",,,,
350,387,"  Yea they, they, I mean, they have a history with that yea",,,,
350,388, Yea ,,,,
350,387, Very much so from college to undergrad to now,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Umm, yea",,,,
350,388, And,,,,
350,388," I, I think it?s really important  ? so especially because of ways I talk to my own parents and sort of feel like respectful relationships should go-",,,,
350,387,  mhm,,,,
350,388," It bothers me when they say things, um, to you like, I mean, so many things but one example that?s especially important is you feel like you can?t talk to them about um like going to therapy or seeing a psychiatrist or anything like that.",,,,
350,387," Well, because their response would be a combination of  ?nothing?s wrong?  ?you?re fine? and ?what?s wrong? like-",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," ?we?ve failed? Um, like they, the the flipside of them being very invested is them feeling personally responsible in me being OK. And if I say that, you know, I?m not OK, they?ll be like ?where did we go wrong? um  and and like feel very responsible and want to fix it themselves-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," -but know that they can?t, so they just don?t want to see that fault is, like it?s",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," It?s a very cyclical thing. Um, and like,",,,,
350,388, And,,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," I also understand, you know, wanting to sort of appear strong for your parents because-",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," So, it?s that?s, it?s difficult that",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388,"And I also think, you know, I mean on the one hand like, oh if you just talk to them about it-",,,,
350,388," You can, you know you can get them to see the right way, but on the other hand I remember last year when you were, when you wanted to ask about, like, seeing a psychiatrist and stuff, because you were like really anxious",,,,
350,388," And like they did not have a good reaction, that made me really upset.",,,,
350,387, Yea that?s that?s partially attitudes towards mind body relationships in the family.,,,,
350,388, mhm,,,,
350,387, That?s one area in which it?s difficult to talk to them,,,,
350,388, mhm,,,,
350,387," Whereas other, other areas, like if it?s financial or if it?s explicitly physical medical, if it?s, you know, stuff going on like, my dad very much wants to find solutions, and my mom also very much wants to find solutions they?re very hands on in that way ",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," and, you know, I mean they, they get into a lot of conflict themselves because they each are, you know",,,,
350,388, yea,,,,
350,387," Controlling is a heavy word for it, but like they-",,,,
350,387, -they like to be in charge of the things that they do-,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," -in, in their domain. So when I approach each of them on something that?s within their domain-",,,,
350,387," Um it?s a separate issue, but like the thing with mental health is that, first of all, like my mom has a mental health history which, which she refuses to-",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," -to deal with. Um  like flat out refuses, acknowledge that it?s true but refuses to deal with it.",,,,
350,387,"  Because of her own psycho-, it, it, it",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," It?s one of those things, um and my dad like exists partially in response to that, and also he?s like very much like like you as an individual are in control, 100%.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, And he knows me,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," And he feels like, you know, like, you know, he says like stress is like the biggest you know, concern of life",,,,
350,387, But at the same time you are in control of your stress.,,,,
350,388," I just, yea",,,,
350,387,"So this is like, uh, yea, so that, that?s their angle on it, the parent dynamic combines with this mental health idea, then you have that spiraling thing. That?s, that?s one area. And then there?s the other area of, um, uh, my parents?s you know, talking about politics.",,,,
350,388,"Yes, yes, I was gonna say that.",,,,
350,387," Not necessarily because like, of their particular political stances. Just because, you know, you come from like a political family-",,,,
350,387, -like an activist-,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," -political family, going out, doing stuff.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," My family, no ",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," We don?t talk about politics, it?s, it?s not a table issue like-",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," -if something were to happen on the news I would sometimes get in some discussion with mom, because she likes arguing with me.",,,,
350,387, It?s fun-,,,,
350,388,  Yea.,,,,
350,387," -for the two of us to argue with each other. It?s part of our dynamic. But  the whole family, no.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Um, rarely discuss anything political.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Um, yea",,,,
350,388," So what, what bothers me about this-",,,,
350,388," Is that we?re existing this time where, like everyone agrees that the most important thing is for people to talk to the people that they?re close to who, who disagree.",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," Who, like maybe voted for Trump, or who don?t vote at all, or-",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," ?all of these things, to, you know, to have those discussions because that?s the only way we can actually change people?s minds. And especially for you-",,,,
350,388," -you?re someone who, you know, is very interested in politics, you study political science, and cares deeply about all of these issues, and, like, you have a unique, like, like you are the person who people are saying, who people are talking about when they say ?white people, talk to your familie.s?",,,,
350,387, Right,,,,
350,387," And they?re in Ohio, so",,,,
350,388," Yea and that?s an important voting state. So I, like, I think it?s extremely, extremely important that you talk to them and at least try to get them to vote, and vote for-",,,,
350,388," -like new age republicans, so",,,,
350,387," Yea, it?s, ",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," Um because, like trying to convince my dad of any political thing, like, whatever position he has it?s not, uh, it?s not a thought out position-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Um, and it?s not going to be changed through a conversation with me. Um, because he, like, if I were to say, he?ll say ?yea I went through that phase?.",,,,
350,387, That?s literally the attitude that he would have.,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, He was like ?your journey?s my journey.? Like-,,,,
350,388,  yea,,,,
350,387, -and he?s like ?I understand? you know .,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," ?But, but I?m somewhere else now?. I don?t even know where that is-",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, Because he doesn?t like talking about it in depth. Um,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," But yea. But my mom, like, she?s just lazy.",,,,
350,388," But like ? and, you mentioned that she gets all of her positions from what she sees on TV.",,,,
350,387, Cable news,,,,
350,388, Yea but,,,,
350,387, At least it?s not Fox.,,,,
350,388, Yea seriously. But like,,,,
350,387, The Today Show,,,,
350,388," But they love you so much  they know that you?re like this smart Phi Beta Kappa, you?re their golden child . So like, I think that you have more sway with them, you could have more sway with them then you think that you do-",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388, -and it bothers me that you don?t try.,,,,
350,387, Yea ,,,,
350,388," I know that you try sometimes, but",,,,
350,387," Cycling back to the, uh, the ?I went through that phase? , like-",,,,
350,388, Yea ,,,,
350,387," You know how, and I?ve said this to you before, you know if I did that they?d be like ?uck, college had such an impact on you,? because growing up, I wasn?t a political person.",,,,
350,388, Mhm ,,,,
350,387," I wasn?t an activist, I have, you know, political opinions and stuff-",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," -but it?s like, I was never like I?m going to protest",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," I was never, I want to, uh, you know, volunteer for a thing.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Because that?s ? it wasn?t, it wasn?t in the family, therefor it wasn?t me.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," And now if I try to bring them back, it?s like ?that?s not you, that?s unnatural,? um.",,,,
350,388," But it is you, this happens to everyone who goes to college.",,,,
350,387, I know,,,,
350,387, And that?s what they?ll say.,,,,
350,388," But, no, but that?s like, also?",,,,
350,387," I know, and it doesn?t mean that I won?t try. I will bring it up, again.",,,,
350,388, Good,,,,
350,387," Like I will, I?ll-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," I?ll bring it up, it?s not hard to bring up, I?m just not confident in the result.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, That?s that.,,,,
350,388, Ok,,,,
350,387," Yea. Um, so there?s the um political side, there?s the mental health side of dealing with parents. Umm",,,,
350,388," There?s other issues that have existed in the past that, I don?t think they give you enough, like, leeway or privacy or-",,,,
350,387, Breathing room ,,,,
350,388, -breathing room,,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," Or, um yea",,,,
350,387, That?s very much true,,,,
350,388," So in those situations, often in the past, I?ve wanted you to tell them that. And I understand why it?s difficult, but you . And, yea.",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,387, My mother?s afraid,,,,
350,388,I know she is,,,,
350,387," She?s a very afraid person. And she wants to know everything, and she wants to have a say in everything, because mama knows best. And, she?s very afraid-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, -for fine reason.,,,,
350,388, Yea sure,,,,
350,387," And uh, and yea so it?s difficult to ask for space.",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, But with my dad understands more,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Like he, like he wants to keep tabs on finances, and course and like school stuff-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, -because that?s very important to him.,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, Umm and like he feels like there?s a benefit in micromanaging that.,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, Umm but he does give me space in terms of-,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," -you know, me life.",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387,  And he does recognize that I should have a sphere of privacy-,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," Umm, and so reminding him of that, that can have results.",,,,
350,388, Ok. That?s good.,,,,
350,387," Yea, umm",,,,
350,388," But like not enough for you to be able to say, like, ?I want to see a doctor, I have this problem that I want to deal with?",,,,
350,387, Cause that?s moving into that other territory,,,,
350,388," yea, but I mean. I know, but I think that they?re related.",,,,
350,387,They are,,,,
350,388," But I mean at the bottom, the bottom line is that you know yourself better than they do. I know you may not believe that-",,,,
350,388," But you do, and you know it if you?re like, you?re having a problem and I just, right now it?s, it?s, it?s ok, it?s a little bit easier because you can just see someone at Columbia-",,,,
350,387," Yes, thank god for Columbia health services.",,,,
350,388,"But like next year when, when, you know, you?re working and might still be on his health insurance and need to, like, he, I really think it?s going to be for him to-",,,,
350,387," So when I?m making my own salary, and having an independent financial situation-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," -I will, these issues will be discussed, seriously.",,,,
350,388," Ok, I hope so.",,,,
350,387," And I will self advocate in that position, because I will not feel as indebted-",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387," -um, to my parents.",,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, In that regard,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387, Moving forward,,,,
350,388, Ok,,,,
350,387, Yes,,,,
350,388, I?m glad to hear that,,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," Um, I just-",,,,
350,387, I ,,,,
350,388," But, and like, I hope that, that you stick with, stick to that.",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,388," Because just cause, you know it can be, and I understand it can be easy to say now, and when it comes to the time it?s not",,,,
350,387, I?m already feeling it now,,,,
350,388, Yea ok ,,,,
350,387,?even though I?m not even in that position.,,,,
350,388, Yea,,,,
350,387," I like, I know that",,,,
350,388," Cause like, even if, you know, you have a job and you?re supporting yourself-",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
350,387," -mostly, like, I mean, I feel like were both still gonna be at least a little bit, obviously our parents will help for ",,,,
350,387,  Yea,,,,
350,388, You might still be on your dad?s health insurance. So,,,,
350,387," Yea if, if, if I ? so, two things",,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, One you can always pay out of pocket.,,,,
350,388, Mhm. Well.,,,,
350,387, And if that?s like the reasonable thing to do.,,,,
350,388, Mhm,,,,
350,387, Because you know it costs less out of pocket compare to now.,,,,
350,388, What does?,,,,
350,387," I, I?ll, I?ll like have to look into the specifics.",,,,
350,388," N-, n-, yea I mean the out of pocket for like my therapist is ridiculously expensive.",,,,
350,387, right.,,,,
350,388, It?s $13875 per session. And I get,,,,
350,387," That, that?s because it?s, you know, a New York therapist.",,,,
350,388," Yea but like others, you know, others as well, it really adds up if you don?t have insurance.",,,,
350,387, Yea,,,,
351,389, My first impression was that it was pretty broad-,,,,
351,390, Mhmm,,,,
351,389,"  So I think sort of because it?s broad do you wanna talk about the first things that came to mind, and I?ll talk about the first things that came to mind and--",,,,
351,390, Why don?t you start because I?m not sure that I got the prompt correct.,,,,
351,389," Yeah, I mean it was like compromising about future issues. So?",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, That could be anything from like as it means to the wedding to where are we going to live.,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, How big is our household going to be.,,,,
351,390, Right.,,,,
351,389, Where are we gonna send our kids to school. Are we even gonna have kids?,,,,
351,390, Sure. Okay.,,,,
351,389," Um, that was a little presumptuous on my part.",,,,
351,390, So that was one of the questions answered in there that I didn?t think you?d answer. The kids one. But continue.,,,,
351,389, There was a question about kids?,,,,
351,390," No, no, no. it was about future stuff.",,,,
351,389," Oh, okay. Ummm, okay. So like, if we are going immediate, the things that sort of popped into my mind are like, obviously planning the wedding.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, Getting a dog.,,,,
351,389, Uh?,,,,
351,390," K, so you got two.",,,,
351,389," and, uh, to you want to focus on immediate, do you want to focus on long, long term? Where we?re gonna live?",,,,
351,390, We can go through- we can go through a few.,,,,
351,389, How much time we spend with family-,,,,
351,390, Okay,,,,
351,389, I think is a big one for you. What about you? Where is sort of your head?,,,,
351,390," So, you pretty much hit the nail right on the head.",,,,
351,390," I was thinking?first came to mind, was the immediate, was wedding planning.",,,,
351,389, Yeah.,,,,
351,390," the next thing that came to my mind was, um, the dog. Because that one?s a pretty frequent one, and I love dogs and I want one.",,,,
351,389,  Yeah.,,,,
351,390," Um, and then the third one was where we?re gonna live. And then the fourth one was kids. And then?",,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390," The other one, I guess, it, it came up-- well it didn?t come up when I was thinking about here, but the um, the spending time with family one. Also did come to mind.",,,,
351,389," I, it was sort of on the top of mind because of the conversation about Philly this weekend.",,,,
351,390, That?s fair.,,,,
351,389, Yeah. You seemed a little?,,,,
351,390,"  I mean, I?m, I?m busy as well so?",,,,
351,389, But we didn?t talk about it.,,,,
351,389, That?s fair.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Umm, okay so, I guess sort of in the order that you went, wedding planning. I think, you know, we?ve done a fair job at compromising.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389,"  There?s still constantly compromising. I think this one is particularly difficult for us because like, we are not sort of the proxies of our families in this.",,,,
351,390,  Yeah. Yup.,,,,
351,389," But, I?m, I guess a little bit pleasantly surprised that we are on the same page for a lot of this.",,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389," Um, I think like, it really comes down to the rabbi?s mediation party.",,,,
351,390," Which is funny because it?s not really a problem of our disagreement, but by extension?",,,,
351,389, Our families.,,,,
351,390," Yeah. So, although we do?",,,,
351,389, Wedding planning sucks.,,,,
351,390, Wedding planning does. I can agree with you on that one.,,,,
351,389," Oh, okay. Alright. Good. Um, but I mean, I think we?ve come to some fairly easy compromises.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, I think where we differ right now-,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389,"  Is- and correct me if I?m wrong-like, what happens if we can?t get a venue that works for both.",,,,
351,390, For the engagement party you?re saying?,,,,
351,389, Mhmm.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, Who do we defer to? Do we have two?,,,,
351,390, Mmm.,,,,
351,389," Umm, and the rabbi situation is still super not worked out.",,,,
351,390, Yeah. Yeah. I mean we?re supposed to have a discussion with them but we just never have the time.,,,,
351,389,in the calendar,,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389," No, I mean I-",,,,
351,390, It?s just poor planning on both of our parts so?,,,,
351,389," I appreciate the efforts that you?ve made, from like, getting contact--",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389," -- but we also like, haven?t even decided where.",,,,
351,390," Yeah, no I know.",,,,
351,389," If, Calvin made it like pretty clear-",,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389, --where he wants it.,,,,
351,390," And then, and then, our rabbi?s, well my rabbi is in Queens. And then?",,,,
351,389, Yeah but?,,,,
351,390, And then we?re in the city. So it?s inconvenient for everyone.,,,,
351,389," Ehhhh, it?s not really inconvenient for us.",,,,
351,390, So back to??,,,,
351,389, Roslyn?,,,,
351,390," Depends, if we?re already there. If we?re only going back for that it?s a schlep.",,,,
351,389," Yeah, but there?s other things we could get done in the same weekend, you know what I mean?",,,,
351,390, That?s fair. That?s fair.,,,,
351,389," Umm, and I feel like you know, is a great example",,,,
351,390,  Speaking of I'm sorry,,,,
351,389," Umm, where we?re living next year.",,,,
351,390, Not next year. So we have?,,,,
351,389, You mean after law school?,,,,
351,390," Well, we have two-",,,,
351,389, Ohh.,,,,
351,390," We have in six months from now when we?re moving. Ohh, not even six months from now.",,,,
351,389," Okay, yeah.",,,,
351,390," Yeah. And then we have long-term. So I, I would probably-",,,,
351,389, Long-term is not really a disagreement though. Like we have?,,,,
351,390," Short-term is not a disagreement. Long term is more of a disagreement. Well, it?s not a disagreement, it?s more an unknown.",,,,
351,389, We just like haven?t really ?,,,,
351,389," Yeah, I was gonna say, it?s not like we?re arguing. There just-We just haven?t figured it out.",,,,
351,390," Although, the disagree?There is some disagreement where I?m just trying to find the place that?s most convenient no matter where it is. And you would not be willing to go to Jersey City because it has the name Jersey. So.",,,,
351,389, Oh my god.,,,,
351,389," It?s not, it?s not about the name. I just, I, I wanna live in New York. I wanna live in New York, I wanna work in New York.",,,,
351,390, But it-,,,,
351,389, There?s a lot of employment opportunities living in New York City. It?s really important.,,,,
351,390," But you?re 20 minutes away. It?s the same, it?s the same distance whether or not you?re in-",,,,
351,389," No, but I mean like. Okay let?s say that I wanted to run for some type of public office-",,,,
351,390, Okay. Well you could probably without-,,,,
351,389, At some point in the future.,,,,
351,390," But that would be longer term. We wouldn?t be, at that point we?d have already purchased something hopefully. And we?re not purchasing something there. But the point of purchase, we?d be either-",,,,
351,389, I would consider then like an outer borough.,,,,
351,390, --in one of the five boroughs or an outer suburb. Yeah.,,,,
351,389," In like, a less nice area than Jersey.",,,,
351,390, Yeah. But that?s long-term. For like the first few years-,,,,
351,389, Do you even wanna live in Jersey? Or is this just like??,,,,
351,390, No. I?m not saying I wanna live there. But I?m saying I wanna find a commute that?s gonna work for both you and myself for when you?re out of school.,,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390,"  So considering you?re in midtown, Flushing and Jersey City are both just like straight to and lower..",,,,
351,389, you know Flushing is like also equidistant between our jobs and our families. Both of our families.,,,,
351,390, That?s fair.,,,,
351,389, Um?,,,,
351,390," Yeah, but, Flushing you said?",,,,
351,389, Yeah?,,,,
351,390, But Flushing is like an hour away from here.,,,,
351,389," Yeah, but so is Jersey City.",,,,
351,390,  20 minutes.,,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Okay, I have no concept of direction and you know this. Or distance. In this circumstance.",,,,
351,390,  Yes.,,,,
351,389," But I just, I just don?t, I don?t wanna live?It?s not that it?It?s not Jersey specifically, it?s not Connecticut?",,,,
351,390, Mhmm,,,,
351,389," I, I wanna live in New York. Like this is the only place I?ve ever lived.",,,,
351,390, I get it. And long-term we?re going to.,,,,
351,389, It?s the only place you?ve ever lived.,,,,
351,389, But I don?t wanna leave short-term either. Like if it was for?,,,,
351,390, I?m just doing it for the sake of convenience.,,,,
351,389, --A temporary employment opportunity?,,,,
351,390, Okay,,,,
351,389," And you were working in Jersey, that?s a different situation. But if we?re both working in Manhattan-",,,,
351,390, Yeah,,,,
351,389, And our families are on the island-,,,,
351,390, But here?s the thing. Here?s the thing. Is even though we?re both working in Manhattan it may be shorter commute time for us to get to our jobs in Manhattan than living in Manhattan itself.,,,,
351,389, I could say definitively?,,,,
351,390," Like right now, my commute is forty minutes.",,,,
351,389, I would rather take the longer commute if it means living in New York.,,,,
351,390," Okay. Then, then?",,,,
351,389," And that?s just my calculus. You know, if yours is different your is different, and it appears to be.",,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389," But I want you to understand that for me, I would rather commute longer if it meant living in New York.",,,,
351,390, Okay. Well what?s?,,,,
351,389, Especially because like as-,,,,
351,390," -- the basis of living in New York, if it?s not for?so long term you said you wanted to live in New York because of the fact that you?re going to maybe want to run for office, or New York office-",,,,
351,389," Well, long-term I wanna live in New York because this is my favorite place on Earth.",,,,
351,390," Yeah. But then short term, if the only argument is that you think it may have an impact in your future career for something that you?re not necessarily going for now.",,,,
351,389," No, I?m talking about like, the zip code. Um, I?m talking about New York city as opposed to like the suburbs also when I talk about that.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," but, let?s put logic aside for a second. From a like, emotional sensitivity standpoint?",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Like, I don?t want to leave New York.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Unless, you know, it?s a different calculus if we?re talking about like a career opportunity.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," And like, you wanna go to Google-",,,,
351,390, I got a job at Space X. Wanna go to California?,,,,
351,389,"  No, honestly, honestly, if you wanted to go for a couple of years and transfer back that would be something that I would absolutely be o?like, my, you know that my job has offices in ?",,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389, California. Like that?s not a problem.,,,,
351,390, Good luck convincing your mom though.,,,,
351,389, But that-,,,,
351,390," No, I know. I know. I know. I?m just, I?m just teasing.",,,,
351,389," A look, look, if we wanted to go somewhere because there were opportunities there, fine. But I don?t want to leave New York-",,,,
351,390, Ok,,,,
351,390, Alright,,,,
351,389," Conceive? Consider to be no bi?Consider, perceive, conceive, conception.",,,,
351,389," We?re having kids. Um, no. Don?t say that.",,,,
351,390,  we can talk about that afterwards.,,,,
351,389, Seriously.,,,,
351,389," Um, but I, yeah, I don?t reall-",,,,
351,390, Okay. For me living in Jersey City is not really leaving New York.,,,,
351,389, Yeah but it is.,,,,
351,390," Yeah, sure. Anyways, I don?t really care for Jersey to be completely honest.",,,,
351,389, Good.,,,,
351,390, It?s just somewhat- not really Devil?s Advocate but kind of just keeping options open.,,,,
351,389," Okay. We could talk about like, moving in to my grandfather?s apartment.",,,,
351,390, That?s a lot longer commute. He?s nowhere near a train. It would be about an hour.,,,,
351,389, True. But it is a rent regulated unit.,,,,
351,390, That we wouldn?t be able to get rent stabilization for because of our incomes.,,,,
351,389," You can get rent stabilization, um, for um,---I actually don?t know the law about his very well. But he could pass it on to my father potentially and then my father could pa---This is not a topic for conversation, like right now.",,,,
351,390,Fraud. No,,,,
351,389," No, no. Totally legal.",,,,
351,390, Just kidding. ,,,,
351,389," I had a whole conversation with my professor about it today. But, yeah.",,,,
351,390, Okay. What else? Dog? Doggie?,,,,
351,389," Um, that? not something that we need to?Dog.  You know my thoughts on this.",,,,
351,390,And you know my thoughts on this. I want a dog too.,,,,
351,389, But like we?re on the same page.,,,,
351,390," Yes, but our timelines are different.",,,,
351,389, They?re really not.,,,,
351,390," So here?s my thought on?well, biggest reason why I think we shouldn?t get a dog is because, well, Columbia housing wouldn?t allow you to have a dog.",,,,
351,389, Unless it is an emotional service animal.,,,,
351,390," Unless it is an emotional service animal, which I can get.",,,,
351,389, Mhmm.,,,,
351,390," But, then we had the discussion about, first of all, the timing of it is that?we don?t have time to train a puppy right now. And you don?t want to have someone else train our puppy for us.",,,,
351,389, Disagree.,,,,
351,390, Why?,,,,
351,389, I?ve trained two dogs.,,,,
351,390, You?re busier now than ever. Yeah and you spend those?,,,,
351,389, No I?m not. I?m not. I?m definitely not.,,,,
351,390, Okay. Well I busier now cause I just started a new gig.,,,,
351,389, I was way busier first year.,,,,
351,390, I?m busier now than I was at the end of my previous job. And I probably will be for the foreseeable future. And that?s that.,,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390," The timeline of the wedding. What are we going to do with the dog before, during, after the wedding? If we go on honeymoon?",,,,
351,389,Pick me. Pick me.,,,,
351,390," Okay. Yeah, what?",,,,
351,389, okay-,,,,
351,390, Now are we just gonna take the dog o?,,,,
351,389, No. If we get a dog right now-,,,,
351,390, K,,,,
351,389, Okay. The biggest obstacle we have is Lexie.,,,,
351,390," Well, for her staying by your parents.",,,,
351,389," Mhmm, or going home?",,,,
351,390, She can stay by my parents.,,,,
351,389, I?m saying for like the purpose of me going home-,,,,
351,390, Or she can stay at?,,,,
351,390, Like any of our friends can watch him in the city too.,,,,
351,389," You said her, and then him and it was very cute.",,,,
351,390, What?,,,,
351,389,The puppy.,,,,
351,390, Oh.,,,,
351,389," Um, okay, so that, that?s an obstacle. But if we got the dog together before the wedding-",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, You?ve like seen wedding picture where like people incorporate like the dog that they share. It?s very cute.,,,,
351,390, Yeah.,,,,
351,389, You do it before the ceremony. And then like-,,,,
351,390, Oh you?re saying just for the engagement shoot.,,,,
351,389, Correct. Or for the pre-wedding pictures-,,,,
351,390, But wouldn?t you want Lexie?,,,,
351,389," Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think you could do both of those in different picture without it being like a conflict.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, I think if we were to get a dog right now-,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389," I?d be able to walk it every morning and every night. I think the biggest difference would not be like, the amount of time that we dedicate, it would be like, the kind of recreation that we have. Like the time that we spend now watching Netflix, which is like a good deal of time?",,,,
351,390, For you. ,,,,
351,389,  Fine. The time I spend watching-,,,,
351,390, Which is weird because you should be the busier one.,,,,
351,389, It is like the time I would spend walking the dog.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, I think it?s gonna encourage happiness. I think it?s gonna encourage commitment. I mean you?ve read the studies I?m talking about.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, But I also think that it?s gonna encourage exercise.,,,,
351,390, K. No room in our apartment. At all. No room in the apartment.,,,,
351,389," K, but we?re moving.",,,,
351,390," Into an apartment that?s gonna be pretty equal in size. No room, and we?re not going to be necessarily near a park. Uh--",,,,
351,389," But, we are gonna be necessarily near a park.",,,,
351,390, Okay. So that um?,,,,
351,389," By the way?okay, there?s something to be said for a dog that grows up in a large space.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389," Like if we moved Lexie in the apartment, you saw when she was in the apartment-",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, Like she hated it and wanted out.,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389,"  But if you have like a) a smaller animal, and b) they grow up in that size space, they acclimate to it.",,,,
351,390," I mean we would get a lazy dog, lazier breed in general for the smaller apartment. That?s not a question.",,,,
351,389, Yeah.,,,,
351,390," But the point though is that like, so, I just lost my train of thought. Sorry.  just trying not to focus on the cameras there. Um, so, if I wanted to have a kid right now. And I?m not trying to move of the dog topic, I?m just using this as an analogy.",,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390, If I wanted to have a kid like right now.,,,,
351,389, Mhmm.,,,,
351,390,  Let?s say we were married at this time.,,,,
351,389, Mhmm.,,,,
351,390, And you?re-,,,,
351,389, We?ve gotten so far off.,,,,
351,390," And you?re in school and I?m just starting a new job and whatnot. Would you not think you would prefer not to have something that is dependent on you? Um, that you wouldn?t necessarily be able to?",,,,
351,389, Are you talking about a child?,,,,
351,390, I?m-- It?s an analogy. You can use a child or a dog.,,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390, There somewhat synonymous in this example because-,,,,
351,389, Of figuring out would I want a child,,,,
351,390, For all intents and purposes we?re getting a dog sitter versus a babysitter. We?re gonna need-,,,,
351,389," Okay. So, one. You can leave a dog home alone.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390, But not for extended periods of time.,,,,
351,389, Correct. But you can never ever leave an infant home alone.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, Okay. But the dog you can put out a bowl of food and they will feed themselves. Unless it?s Lexie .,,,,
351,389," With an infant, you need to feed them. Okay?",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, With a dog-,,,,
351,390, Unless they?re me.,,,,
351,389," Fair. With a dog, okay, you are dealing with, you know. You take them out around meal times. You have to train them early.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, With a child you have to constantly be changing diapers. You have to be waking up in the middle of the night-,,,,
351,390," Well, what if you house trained them?",,,,
351,389, What do you mean?,,,,
351,390," We?re only here at, we?re only home on weekends. During the day they?re going to be presumable sitting in an apartment for a couple of hours between either-",,,,
351,389," So at the beginning we, we have them newspaper trained.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," And, what do you ? I?m gone at most, on like a single day, from like 1",50 to like 6.,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, So that?s like four hours. Which means that I?m home the vast majority of the day.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," I can be home-further, we have a million and one friends who are dying to get a dog right now. You don?t think Liam would be willing to stop by the apartment if god forbid?",,,,
351,390, Would you be?would you trust people to-,,,,
351,389,  A hundred percent.,,,,
351,390, With keys?,,,,
351,389,  A hundred percent.,,,,
351,390, Not necessarily Liam.,,,,
351,390," I?m saying a random dog walker. Blah, blah, blah.",,,,
351,389, No. But I-,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389, I would trust Liam. I would trust Julia. I would trust Sam.,,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Um, even like Kim next door.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," Yeah. We could, we could, if we like had a day where we had an issue, we could offer to walk like, our dog and Benji.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, And then the next day she could like walk our dog and Benji. You know?,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, I don?t think that that?s a big issue.,,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389," I feel like we have strong enough support systems, between like our parents being able to like watch, able and willing to watch a dog-",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389," And like our friends, that all of the obstacles you?re talking about are not insurmountable.",,,,
351,390, Okay.,,,,
351,389," The biggest issue I think is like, you know, I do have a dog that doesn?t like other dogs, and like I don?t wanna-",,,,
351,390, And we?re in a building that doesn?t allow dogs unless it?s an emotional support animal.,,,,
351,389, We?ve talked about this.,,,,
351,390," And, I get it.",,,,
351,389, But-,,,,
351,390, But-,,,,
351,389," Okay, realistically-",,,,
351,390," I mean, those are the two blockers really.",,,,
351,389," Realistically, we?re gonna want an emotional; support animal regardless.",,,,
351,390, That?s fair. But-,,,,
351,389, both for the benefits of an emotional support animal and because we don?t want to make our property options contingent on finding a dog friendly building.,,,,
351,390, But I think that we both did have good ideas in terms of both being able to please you for having a- for being able to-,,,,
351,389,  Sorry.,,,,
351,390,  For being able to pl- cause what,,,,
351,389,"Please, please me. Let?s go Beatles here.",,,,
351,389," Long story short, you just wanna play with a dog because you love dogs. They?re really cute. I want that  the same thing.  ",,,,
351,390, No.,,,,
351,389, But you can?t walk down the street without petting any dog that passes by.,,,,
351,389, But-,,,,
351,390, And I think it?s adorable.,,,,
351,389, It?s much more than wanting it because I want to play with it.,,,,
351,390," No, no. Of course. Of course.",,,,
351,390," But now my concerns though, is for the dog, itself. So for the long term for our dog is that we?re gonna be moving from, from, twice within the matter of two years. Correct?",,,,
351,389, Okay.,,,,
351,390, We?re gonna be busy-,,,,
351,389, We?re not gonna be going very far.,,,,
351,390," I understand that. But still, for a younger dog to acclimate it?s kind of difficult. And what we could do, and the suggestion is that you may as I do, is that you become a dog walker so that you?re able to play with other dogs. Or, my suggestion was that we?",,,,
351,389," Yeah, but we?ve talked about it.",,,,
351,390, - that we try to foster dogs.,,,,
351,390," If we would be able to foster a dog or two for periods of time in which someone else is able to adopt them. Yeah, um-",,,,
351,389," So, here?s the, two issues. Um, and those are great solutions. I don?t wanna in any way minimize them.",,,,
351,390, Mhmm.,,,,
351,389, The dog walker we?ve talked about that-,,,,
352,392, Why did you go to the bathroom?,,,,
352,391, I really had to pee.,,,,
352,392, Oh.,,,,
352,391, Is that bad?,,,,
352,392, No. ,,,,
352,391, Okay?.sex. ,,,,
352,392, You looked really good this morning.,,,,
352,391, Thank you.  Okay. I have to get back to that comfortable place.  Thanks.,,,,
352,392," I mean, do you think there?s been like a difference",,,,
352,391, Yeah.,,,,
352,392, Of before and now?,,,,
352,391," I mean, not in terms of like frequency, but at least like we?re more aware about it. And then, we?ve just been like having so much fun doing other things that it?s easy for it not to come up often.",,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391, Because we?re like pretty happy otherwise.,,,,
352,391," But I guess we shouldn?t let it, like?what?s it called when you forget about something? Let it like, go on the back burner.",,,,
352,392, Hmm. ,,,,
352,391, What do you think?,,,,
352,392," Yeah. I think that?s true. There?s also, uh? Staying in the apartment all day is not good.",,,,
352,391," Yeah. Cause we work. I mean I work outside, but yeah. You?re working in this studio all day, so you have to like?",,,,
352,392, Going to the gym is helping though.,,,,
352,391," Yeah, and we haven?t?",,,,
352,392, It?s just clarity of mind.,,,,
352,391," And we haven?t been going to the gym?well you haven?t been going for very long. So maybe like, the more regular that is?Well what do you think?",,,,
352,392, Yeah. It?s like.It?s not like? I feel like the physical exercise helps?umm?,,,,
352,391," Do you feel like on a day that you work out, the next morning do you feel like you wake up with more energy?",,,,
352,392, Not yet. I feel like my body is still like?,,,,
352,392, Getting to that point you know. I wake up and I feel like it?s battered.,,,,
352,392, But I think I?ll get there. I think it?s a matter of having stamina. Right?,,,,
352,391, yeah.,,,,
352,392," I don?t know. Maybe like---yeah, more?maybe a matter of stamina energy. Yeah, stamina, energy.",,,,
352,392, Yeah. It?s funny to talk about it. Because we?ve talked about it so much,,,,
352,391, Yeah,,,,
352,392, Before. You know? ,,,,
352,391," Well, yeah, I guess like what?s new since we talked about it before? We?re exercising.",,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391," And like you?ve definitely been giving me a lot more affection since you got back. That, that I think helps. Like maybe I also haven?t noticed so much like, so much time going by, because I?m like getting so much affection from you otherwise. So I feel like really happy?",,,,
352,392, Mhmm.,,,,
352,391, With that?So tha- thank you.,,,,
352,392,"   feel like I should be trying more, you know.",,,,
352,391, Yeah-,,,,
352,392," Like this morning, I was like, feeling it ",,,,
352,391,"  I think maybe it just is for you, like when it?s not a possibility, cause I had to leave, so you?re like",,,,
352,391, That?s okay. That?s still good.,,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391, To have that.,,,,
352,392," Yeah, I don?t know what ?how other people are. You know?",,,,
352,391," Like, if?yeah.",,,,
352,392, --in relationships.,,,,
352,391, When it comes to sex?,,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391," it?s pretty com?I think it?s like, I think it?s pretty normal for it to taper off, but I don?t know.",,,,
352,392," Because, like I-I said in-- I was thinking, I was very embarrassed. When we first met like, that was like a foundation for so long.",,,,
352,391, You think so?,,,,
352,392, Yeah. Because we had sex like really fast.,,,,
352,391, Yeah that is true.,,,,
352,392," And then, every time we hung out it was just pretty much sex all the time.",,,,
352,392," And then we came back and like the vacations, we just sex all the time.",,,,
352,391, That?s true.,,,,
352,392," And then, when I went down we had sex all the time. When we moved up, sex all the time. So?I can see how it was like disturbing for you for that to have stopped.",,,,
352,391, Yeah.,,,,
352,392," And for me, it?s like the closer I got to you otherwise.",,,,
352,391, Awww.,,,,
352,392, The physical thing just tapered off for me.,,,,
352,391, Because you feel more comfortable?,,,,
352,392," Yeah, or I thought there was more to it than that. But it?s not like a made a conscious decision you know?",,,,
352,391, Right,,,,
352,392, it just happened that way.,,,,
352,392," Yeah?.I wonder if it?s usually the guys want more sex, and girl doesn?t want to do it.",,,,
352,391," I feel like, because of like public, like I feel like, you know the stereotypes of men and women, I feel like the story always is that, yeah it?s like the women.",,,,
352,392, Yeah,,,,
352,391, But then I think that there?s like a surprisingly larger amount of men that lose their sex?that have low sex drive. And it?s just not talked about as much as women.,,,,
352,392, yeah that?s also like?just puts extra pressure on me and you. Like I feel like I shouldn?t be the one feeling this way.,,,,
352,391," Yeah, like stereotypically you would think that it would be reversed. But then I think a lot of strife for the guy, is like performance things so, that, if that aff?that makes it even harder for you to perform because you don?t feel like?I don?t know. I feel like that puts even more  pressure on guys, men in general to perform. Like that stereotype.",,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391, Did that make any sense?,,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391,"And maybe, like I?ve fallen out of the stereotype of women too because like, when we?ve, before when we were having sex all the time I was like, exclusively groomed and then when we stopped having sex so much I get a little bit lazier, and like not shaving my legs as much, and like not, like, do, like even right now, like I don?t have like makeup on, like mascara and stuff like that. So I wonder if like, that?s, I?ve like, I?m not trying to like, I don?t know?what the woman does to like attract the guys. Like, in a way I?ve kind of like given up on that because it?s been so long. And then it also, I think like doesn?t help our situation.  It?s like a catch 22.",,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391, Like maybe if I like dressed up more?And looked attrac?I don?t know.,,,,
352,392, Yeah?I don?t know.,,,,
352,392, I-,,,,
352,391," Yeah. I have to like, maybe find some motivation to like?",,,,
352,392,  Get some abs.,,,,
352,391," Cause that?s also I think the stereotype for the girl too, yeah. It?s like, why would the guy?Like, the stereotype is that the girl is the one who is gonna lose interest. So it affects your self-esteem, and like, your pressure to perform, and then it affects my self-esteem, cause I?m like, oh my god, what?s wrong with me. There must be something wrong with me.",,,,
352,392, Mmm.,,,,
352,391, So maybe we need to like?I don?t know.,,,,
352,391, We just need to bang it out. ,,,,
352,392, Yeah. ,,,,
352,391,"  This is how we would really have the conversation, so?",,,,
352,392, Ha.,,,,
352,391," Like, say bang it out ",,,,
352,392, Yeah. We?ve had tense conversations about this so many times.,,,,
352,391, I feel like we?re in like?yeah.,,,,
352,392, I feel like we are truly in a better spot.,,,,
352,391, Me too.,,,,
352,392, Than before.,,,,
352,391, Thank you.,,,,
352,392,  It?s like therapy for ourselves.,,,,
352,391," We should definitely keep like, going?like you definitely also, to the gym.",,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391," Definitely keep working out. And like, like, we definitely need to keep working out, eating healthy, getting enough sleep. And like, you?ve been getting up earlier and that?s really good. And if, you?re feeling like, working in the apartment is affecting you that much, then maybe we need to find another stu?like maybe finding another studio should become more of a priority.",,,,
352,392," But it?s only temporary, you know?",,,,
352,391," Right. So then, we, if we know that there is a date coming up that this situation wil like?That?s true.",,,,
352,392," Yeah, yeah.",,,,
352,391, What else do you think?,,,,
352,392," Hmmm.   That we need to figure out ways to like, spice it up.",,,,
352,391,  Okay.,,,,
352,392," Like, need to do some newness of some kind.",,,,
352,391," Yeah, of course.",,,,
352,392, How do you do that?,,,,
352,391," You just have to do it. You just have to like, start something.",,,,
352,392," Yeah, but what is that?",,,,
352,391, I don?t know. Whatever you want.,,,,
352,392, Okay. We talked about some of it.,,,,
352,391," Yeah, we already talked about that. ",,,,
352,391," I wonder if any couples start like, doing it right on the camera?No whatever you want.",,,,
352,392, Okay.,,,,
352,392, But I?m happy that you feel a little bit better about it.,,,,
352,391, Yeah. Thank you.,,,,
352,391," That means, means a lot to me.",,,,
352,392, Really? ,,,,
352,391, yeah. It?s a big deal.,,,,
352,392, Yeah.,,,,
352,391, Thank you.,,,,
352,392, You?re welcome.,,,,
352,392,This place is?,,,,
352,391, it makes me miss working at Cornell.,,,,
352,392, That?s what I was thinking.,,,,
352,391," Yeah, like even when I was just in the building sitting there, and like people were coming out of some talk or something, I was like ahh?",,,,
352,392, I miss walking?,,,,
352,391, I miss the stimulation?,,,,
352,392," Into that gate area almost. I was like oh wow, school, college.",,,,
352,391," Yeah. I definitely miss it. Maybe that?s another thing like?like, I don?t know, that affects the sex at all. Make sure that we?re stimulated. But I?ve been taking a lot of classes. Like I definitely feel intellectually stimulated. But definitely coming on the campus today was like, oh right. This is what it was like. And I do miss that. But I don?t think it has anything to do with sex or no sex.",,,,
352,392, Mmm.,,,,
352,392, That?s the timer.,,,,
352,391, All we need is fifteen minutes. That?s all we need to designate.,,,,
352,392, To talk about it.,,,,
352,391, No to actually do it. ,,,,
353,393, Alright. Come on and go first.,,,,
353,394," Well, I mean. We was writing on two different papers. So? my issue was punctuality. Which topic was you talking about this particular time?",,,,
353,393,Whatever you wrote on your paper just now.,,,,
353,394," No, it was something she asked us.",,,,
353,393, She said discuss whatever you just wrote on that paper.,,,,
353,394," Well, uh, what did I write?...Um, I wrote about disagreements. Like, more of a common thing that people usually having issues with. Being able to agree with each other. The arguments, so-",,,,
353,393, Mhmm.,,,,
353,394," I basically?explained that I try to go about it with you by at least, being?trying to be patient. To at least try to understand where you?re coming from first. And during a discussion if we can?t agree upon nothing, hope that we could just come to like some common ground of understanding so that we no longer have to go back and forth.",,,,
353,393,Alright,,,,
353,394," Okay, so??",,,,
353,393,That?s it?,,,,
353,394, Yeah. There wasn?t really a lot to put.,,,,
353,393," You sure? That?s, that?s all you wanted to say?",,,,
353,394, Yes.,,,,
353,393, Okay.,,,,
353,394,"Cause above all you have to think about it. If we?re going back and forth it could-- shoot, we?re on camera, it could be about a camera. It could be about a clock, a chair, a table. It really doesn?t matter. What matters amongst a disagreement is when you?re the person to finally be like, you know what? Well this is what we agree upon, so we can be able to get over that hurdle, that hump, instead of staying stuck there and not being able to solve it, and always having it in the back of your head like, oh I wish I could have tried to fix that.",,,,
353,393,"Okay. Hmm, what?",,,,
353,394, You don?t have anything to express?,,,,
353,394,  Aw man. You shy now because the cameras is on?,,,,
353,393,No. I?m not shy at all.,,,,
353,394," Alright, so what do you think about what I just said?",,,,
353,393,I understand and I agree? For the first time.,,,,
353,394,  For the first time?,,,,
353,393, Yeah. In a long time.,,,,
353,393, I understand though.,,,,
353,394, But what do you think? Like-,,,,
353,393, Um-,,,,
353,394," What else do you think will help work with that? Like, this is two minds here. We should work together on this.",,,,
353,393,"Well, first of all. I?m just gonna say what I put on my paper. My argument, my disagreement with you, out of all the topics, is I don?t like the way you react to how I react to environments that are negative with people I may not know and people I do know. And the fact that you just seem to be all cool and calm and collective, and just stay to yourself and you?re just comfortable no matter where you?re at, or who you?re around whether you know them or not. And the fact that you respond to me, and react to me in a way where, oh I hate the way you act like this, I hate the way you think like that, and that bothers me. And it?s always gonna bother me because a lot of people within the last, maybe, more than seven years, have said the same thing. It?s not just you. But the fact that you make more emphasis on it, a lot of people just say, you know what? I give up after the first couple of times. You keep pushing the issue. And that is something that is very annoying to me. And I will never get over that. Because I know how I can react to situations. Like, for example, and this seems to happen all the time-",,,,
353,393," Cause it ain?t just happen with you. It happened with Darnell before when I was in a relationship with him too. The fact that I?m in a store?and this is only one analogy. There?s plenty of them. But this is one that will definitely stick in my head forever. I?m in a store. I go to the store. I ask them may I get a cigarette or something or something that you know, over eighteen, people that?s over the age of eighteen may buy. And the people behind the cash register?s looking at me like, okay, well, I don?t know if I should give it to you because you look like a child. But I?m not. I?m a grown ass woman.",,,,
353,393," I should be able to get whatever I want without even pulling out my ID. So I get frustrated, if these are the same exact store that I never have to pull my ID out for, yeah I?m gonna get frustrated with them. Yeah, I?m gonna have something to say, and yes I?m gonna catch an attitude. The first thing you and Darnell do is,  yo why you gotta be like that? Yo, I hate when you do that, like it?s really not that serious. He don?t know how old you are. That?s just protocol, dude, why you doing that? Why you outside acting like that?",,,,
353,393,"Because, I want to. And if I really want to, I can get worse than that. If I really want to. But because I have to think about the next person, and make it the next person, cause make it considerate to the next person to make them feel comfortable.  Pthh, well now it?s just like, alright, well I look stupid now. And I hate that feeling. And that?s only one example. But there?s so many.",,,,
353,394,Yeah but why do you think you look stupid because you?re making a sacrifice for the better? Sometime setting your s?setting your feelings aside?,,,,
353,393,Doing what?,,,,
353,394," No, cause you, you just said that in that moment I gotta make the sacrifice to basically hold my tongue, so nothing will escalate?",,,,
353,393,I don?t feel it?s just me holding my tongue-,,,,
353,394, --between me and the ,,,,
353,393," I feel like it?s also my attitude, my reaction.",,,,
353,393,"ike I said, what I wrote on that paper is my reaction. That?s the very first, the very first line I put on that paper is my reaction. Don?t like the way I may react to negative environments to people I may know or I may not know.",,,,
353,393," And that?s something that bothers me. Because you can be all cool and calm and collective, you be yourself and you don?t care. You can be insensitive to the people around you, and be on and on point. Doesn?t mean I?m not on point. I just may react a different way because I?m a different person. Just because we?re together doesn?t mean we?re always gonna do everything alike. Like, me and you were not born literally together. So my thing is, if I react that way you should be able to respect it because if it was the other way around I would have to respect it whether I like it or not either. And that was my issue. My main issue with you this whole time.",,,,
353,394," yeah, but that issue was ongoing and constant with you towards me because when I needed you to just respect something for what it was, like, me keeping a job and stuff like that, you ain?t wanna do that. Until a long time coming now. So its like, I get what you?re saying but it, it gotta go both ways too.",,,,
353,393,"Yeah, I know. I knew you was gonna flip it.",,,,
353,394, I?m not flipping it.,,,,
353,393," That?s, that?s-",,,,
353,393, That?s what you do with everything that I have something to say about.,,,,
353,394, I?m just saying it gotta go both ways.,,,,
353,394, Now I?m flipping it. Whatever. That means I don?t have nothing else to say.,,,,
353,393, You can say whatever you want.,,,,
353,394," No, I don?t have nothing else to say.",,,,
353,393," Pshh. Now for the world to see, right? Say whatever you want. At the end of the day, this is the reason why I didn?t want to say anything. Cause what?s the point of us discussing anything when every time we do discuss stuff, whether it?s on camera or not, whether it?s for other people to see that don?t know us, the whole point is it?s gonna remain the same. Gonna keep having the same responses, the same reactions. Same attitude. The same topics of discussion of disagreements to talk about. Like I?m tired of that. In fact I even brung that up. I shouldn?t have even brung it up. Cause what?s the point? You gonna always have something to what? Conflict whatever I say, debate whatever I say?  I don?t, I just, you know, whatever. I just felt like that was just a major thing to me and that?s what I wrote on that paper. As far as the back of the paper, the way I could handle it by coming to you and approaching you to discuss any disagreements we have, of any topic. I feel like I should start a little bit more dumbing it down with my attitude. And hearing you out first, before I even say anything at all, and whether I like something that you say or not, whether I agree with it or not, I should be more understanding towards you. And that?s something I have been working on way before today. But my thing is, is I have to push myself more if I?m gonna even deal with you for like five more years, ten more years, twenty more years. End up in a marriage, end up having kids, having our own house. I have to start doing that. My thing is is whenever you decide to, then you decide to. I can?t make you do anything. And I been realized that since two years ago. I can?t. So whatever way you decide you wanna keep responding, or keep reacting to stuff that?s on you.",,,,
353,393," But what?s up to me, is how I react to stuff.  I?m just really kind of just tired of really just disagreeing about the same stuff. But,  it?s a work in process, process within myself, not even just with others. Cause I?m just really kind of just tired of it. And that?s one thing that really just sticks out to me all the time. Like, after we leave here, who knows what might happen.  Might end up getting into another disagreement or argument about something so stupid, like, like how you reacted to the fact that I wanna go this way and you wanna go down this avenue.  Come on, like  it just doesn?t make no sense. And most of the time, it actually happens when we?re outside. When we?re going somewhere. Today I?m kind of surprised that that did not happen. On our way coming over here.",,,,
353,394,"I guess, I got an idea of why it didn?t happen. Cause you was, your mind was already distracted with something else that you was thinking about. Plus, you had this on your mind because we was coming to Columbia to participate in this, this program or whatever. So you had two things distracting you. If you ain?t have those two things distracting you, you would have did the typical you, I?m out in the street but I don?t like people, so something would have aggravated you. Even if it would have been somebody looking at you.",,,,
353,393,That?s a funny word. Little do you know.,,,,
353,394," And then you probably would have been like, oh no I, I don?t wanna go.",,,,
353,393, You really don?t know what was on my mind walking here.,,,,
353,393," What was on my mind, and the only thing on my mind, besides getting here, was just simply all day, and yesterday. I constantly have to be yelled at about something.",,,,
353,394, Um?,,,,
353,393, Disrespected about something.,,,,
353,394, So yeah. You?re saying something that I already knew was on your mind.,,,,
353,393, You didn?t just say that.,,,,
353,394," Right. I didn?t say it in that manner, but only because I didn?t say it like that don?t mean I didn?t know. I?m just speaking of it-",,,,
353,393, Okay then. Fine.,,,,
353,394," Look my thing is is this. Despite what the situation is, like I said, I don?t care who?s wrong, I don?t care who?s right. I don?t care who started it first. I don?t care who started it after. What I care about is logical thinking. Critical thinking. Making sense of it. And just finding a solution and getting it over with.",,,,
353,393," Well, I feel like I?m the opposite. I just wanna get rowdy, make my point. You better hear me. I don?t care. You better respect what I say. If you don?t then you?re gonna have more of a problem.",,,,
353,394," And yeah. Yeah, that?s why",,,,
353,393, And then we?ll figure out a solution when I calm down.,,,,
353,394," Yeah, and you can?t always do that. Cause people who lose they head, that?s how you sometimes end up losing everything.",,,,
353,393, I already did.,,,,
353,394, And that?s why you gotta learn how to keep that under control when the heat is on.,,,,
353,393, Mhmm.,,,,
353,394, Cause I think the thing-,,,,
353,393," Well, I already lost everything. I don?t have nothing anyway. The only thing I have left is you. And once that?s gone I definitely ain?t got shit at all. So?",,,,
353,394,You can have anything that you want.,,,,
353,393,  No I can?t.,,,,
353,394, Yes you can.,,,,
353,393, Pshh. Not in this messed up world.,,,,
353,394," You gotta be focused on attaining it. And at the same time, like you said earlier, it?s about self-development. You gotta build yourself and become a better you.",,,,
353,393," Yeah. But, you know how negative I am and some make it harder so?",,,,
353,394," Yeah it can make it harder, but that don?t mean that you don?t have the choice. We always have the choice to make something happen for our self.",,,,
353,393, Okay.,,,,
353,394," That, that?s when logical thinking comes into play cause sometimes the world does get that crazy and does become that stressful-",,,,
353,393, But you acting like I don?t know that already.,,,,
353,394," Yeah, but you have to be willing to apply it. You gotta like, just go at it.",,,,
353,393," Okay, but you act like I haven?t done that before. The whole thing is is I done been through too many experiences that show me that sometimes it don?t work. Even when you?re trying to do the right thing or the logical thing-",,,,
353,394, Listen-,,,,
353,393, It does not work sometimes-,,,,
353,394, Listen-,,,,
353,393, Because other- you have to think about other people?s reactions. They?re not like you. They?re not gonna automatically-,,,,
353,394, Why should that matter?,,,,
353,393," --do exactly what you think they gonna, how they gonna react to what you say or whatever you do?",,,,
353,394, But see?But see-,,,,
353,394, Once again you?re worried about the next person.,,,,
353,393, That?s not worried about the next person. That?s something my mother taught me-,,,,
353,394, Because you?re saying-,,,,
353,393, Because that was something that was a problem of mine that I have to deal with on my own.,,,,
353,394, Yeah-,,,,
353,393, And I always had to deal with on my own.,,,,
353,394, So what are you saying? That?s a problem for you? To just be nice or something? So a person won?t have to get mad?,,,,
353,393, What are you talking about?,,,,
353,393," My mother told me that stop expecting people to react, respond in a certain way that you want them to because they never will. And that was always my problem. Based off whatever I would say or how I would do things. I?m expecting your reaction, your response to be a certain way based off whatever I say or whatever do.",,,,
353,394, But that?s not logical.,,,,
353,393,"Okay. Once again, it?s going over the head. Never mind.",,,,
353,394, It?s not. I?m piggy backing.,,,,
353,393," Um, no. It is going over your head.",,,,
353,394, How? How is it going over my head?,,,,
353,393,  Nevermind.,,,,
353,394, All I did was elaborate on what you just said.,,,,
353,393, Never mind you know. Don?t worry about it.,,,,
353,394,Whatever. I?m always wrong. Exactly why they don?t have that old saying for nothing.,,,,
353,393, Okay.,,,,
353,394, The woman is always right.,,,,
353,394,Whatever. I?ll just wait for my death.,,,,
353,393," And then that?s always your ending response. Like, it don?t make no sense.",,,,
353,394,Because it ain?t nothing ever gonna change.,,,,
353,393, I?m not trying to make you feel like that. But I am still upset about whatever I was upset about before I even got here. So.,,,,
353,394, You can?t?you gone always be that way.,,,,
353,393, Yeah. ,,,,
353,393, That?s just the way it is.  I?m gonna feel whatever way I wanna feel.,,,,
354,396, What is that is that mean?,,,,
354,395, Like a problem with  or whatever.,,,,
354,396," Ok I prefer, I prefer the mass type on my end ",,,,
354,395," I put that, we could keep talking about it.",,,,
354,396, Yea ,,,,
354,395, You?ve seen the apartments that won?t let us get another cat.,,,,
354,396, Ok ,,,,
354,396," So have enough, I wanted that say that, well one thing the landlord did mention, I mean, we haven?t seen him in a while, which is great-",,,,
354,396," -he did see it, did mention it. So I don?t know if later on that will come up somehow, where there will be another, some other stupid thing where they check the bathroom and are like ?oh it?s messy?. Or  an exterminator. But um, besides that also I was thinking about company, like Bella, they try to drop by and see Wolfie and say like ?no? or also play the games but I so ?no? because of the mess, you know . So it was, if we had it clean, we could maybe have Dan and Bella come up, and um and also remember we did that study, I  first came over ? I think that day I kind of neated up a little bit but it was still pretty messy . So I don?t know how, and things are worse now than it was so?",,,,
354,395,  You have too many toys.,,,,
354,396,"That?s the thing, I cleaned",,,,
354,396," -I cleaned everything, remember it was kind of ? it was so messy but it was better. And now everything I?ve got since then that space I made that, all of the boxes are piled up, so, that?s my fault, you know.  I have storage, but a situation like that, I mean it?s almost full so?",,,,
354,396," But, you know, one thing I can do, my plan is to, eventually, is to consolidate all of that. I showed you the videos come in a box but they take a lot of space, I could put a bunch of, I could combine them so there?s like four boxes but I could get all of those put into one of those four, so that would, you know, cut down on boxes.",,,,
354,395,Or get a bigger place.,,,,
354,395, I don?t know,,,,
354,396," Yea, well there was that lottery we, I actually didn?t do it . I had it in my bookmarks save, and I just kept putting it off . There?s so many things to fill out, it?s like no form I?ve ever seen, and it?s just, it?s so, like daunting that I?m like ?ah? I would, the end result I want-",,,,
354,395, So your job interview?,,,,
354,396," I want, like this sounds like a great place-",,,,
354,395,  interviews,,,,
354,396," -but there?s so much to fill out, that?s what makes me not want to do it. There?s so much, and I?m thinking, after all that, it?s just a lottery so it?s not even-",,,,
354,395," But you still have to go for an interview if they pick you, you have to go in for the interview and pass that?",,,,
354,396," So honestly, I?ve had it in my bookmarks forever and I haven?t done it and ",,,,
354,395,It?s probably expired,,,,
354,396," That?s what I mean. Honestly, but also we signed a two year lease-",,,,
354,396," -at, where we are now, so",,,,
354,395, I know and you said you probably wouldn?t care,,,,
354,396," Yea, I, I?m-",,,,
354,395,  and now fix apartment and charge more.,,,,
354,396,"Exactly that?s like, we haven?t discussed it recently, but I know that in the past it had come up ? I don?t know if it was before you moved in he actually, it came up and he said ?if you ever leave, it?s, it?s not really a strict thing . Like um, it might say ?no ease, you must give notice? or whatever, but he, they would be happy. I mean, they would come in, you know they story. They would fix it up, and charge twice-",,,,
354,395, I  apartment next to us,,,,
354,396," Not quite as much, but they would charge a lot more",,,,
354,395," Yea, well if it?s 1800 it?s 1800 or whatever.",,,,
354,396," I think they were gonna give us a deal, because I?ve been there, but they were charging the new people like like 18 or 2000 or whatever, so yea they would probably get twice as much, so",,,,
354,395, Yea they don?t care if we move out. They don?t care.,,,,
354,396, They would cry about ?you didn?t give us notice? and they would be like ?yay their gone?,,,,
354,396," To be, I, totally moneywise they would do well, they would double their income with us leaving, so, um . But um I don?t know there?s this discomfort level. It?s a nice spot with the train is right there, there?s key foods, CVS, um, you know , with Starbucks.",,,,
354,395,"I don?t know, I feel like walking",,,,
354,396," I, honestly, I, I don?t-",,,,
354,395," There?s a certain apartment size  that like, two cats.",,,,
354,396," I think, it?s because of, you know honestly, you and your mom had like 100 cats-",,,,
354,395, No,,,,
354,396," -in like a little space. It?s, it?s-",,,,
354,395, No,,,,
354,396," -it?s basically, I mean we?re just getting by with the three of us, I mean you me and Sophie are just getting by, there?s no room for guests to come over. Now, I that your cat ? I just don?t think it?s realistic.",,,,
354,396," I mean the only way we could do it is if we clean every room, like, cause every room, I mean, before, like way before, every room was clear, there was room. There was, there was space for another bed, there was space for there was all kinds of space everywhere. Um, but now, with both of us with a lot of stuff  I can?t imagine any more. Like I said, I can?t even, the chairs even full, you mentioned the chair.  We can?t even-",,,,
354,395,  That?s your fault.,,,,
354,396," Yea . No, I admit my fault, but you you should admit yours. I mean, I gave you that whole room, and it?s full of your stuff. Then in the kitchen is your stuff, and in the hallway.",,,,
354,395,"  Your stuff is in the hallway too, what are you talking about.",,,,
354,396, Not as much.,,,,
354,395, Yea right,,,,
354,396,"I mean honestly, I?m surprised that you, it?s the fact that we are just getting by space wise. I mean we?re already kind of cramped. Like the doorway, honestly like up to the room, it?s like ? I don?t know if you have trouble getting in, but",,,,
354,395,yes,,,,
354,396, So you want to add another cat,,,,
354,395,t?s just a cat. A cat is small.,,,,
354,396," But that thing on the table you have that he doesn?t even play with it anymore, that was your?",,,,
354,395," Yes he does, he did yesterday, scratching it.",,,,
354,396, He just wanted to run away from you.,,,,
354,395, No.,,,,
354,396, No I?m just kidding .,,,,
354,395, He wanted to run away from you never play with him when I?m gone.,,,,
354,396," No I never, never",,,,
354,395, Yea right.,,,,
354,396," No we play, I throw the and he catches it. No, he?s cute . But I don?t think, I don?t think we should get another cat now.",,,,
354,396," What, so you can complain more about it being sick. You?ve got one, plus you?ll get two now visits to the doctor every month.",,,,
354,395,  no.,,,,
354,396, Now you?re playing with that too.,,,,
354,395, No.,,,,
354,396," You we should, I was thinking about me consulting. First it would be consulting with  that?s not going to solve but that would help a little bit. But um. I mean there is room in storage but there?s also the problem we had before about how we get to storage, because neither of us drive. I mean, I had some one guy for back  it is was a long time ago.",,,,
354,395," You offer, but you don?t really mean it.",,,,
354,396," We, we we at that time were talking and going back and forth but then, honestly, on my end I wasn?t calling or anything, so he, I think he noticed that and  is like, but then if I call for that it?s just ",,,,
354,395, Yea,,,,
354,396," So he told me it was just for that and he could tell that, you know, cause he, I think he wanted to be friends, because like everyday he was like ?what are you doing?, do you want to write a set, we?d even go and write a set a few times, and um. So we were together a few times on sets. But that?s, um . I don?t, that?s all, but I have another guy David too, but um, he was, he was strange, so.",,,,
354,396," Remember the guy with the glass, with that whole, that famous thing with the 4 times 5 is 20.",,,,
354,395,"Ohhh that, yea.  ",,,,
354,396," He is different, because he is like, he almost broke up with me as a friend. He said, ?I can?t be your friend anymore, you don?t tall call me?. . He literally did a whole thing like that. And like I couldn?t believe it",,,,
354,396,  cause he was always initiating the conversations or the texting or calling or whatever.,,,,
354,395," Yea like awesome, he can still talk to you.",,,,
354,396," But Austin is like totally back, he unders- he, you know  these shoes he actually got me, his father got me these shoes.",,,,
354,396," And so, no he?s more casual like I said happy birthday recently, that was his birthday. And he said happy birthday to me, and? But he?s more casual. Those two I had to  call them all the time. So, he?s, I think honestly he would still hang out. I really think so, he?s laid back .",,,,
354,395, What was your response?,,,,
354,396," But he was the one who invited me all the time to the games and I said no every time, so he kind of-",,,,
354,395, Kind of stopped?,,,,
354,396," Kind of stopped. But I think if I said ?Listen, Friday I?m available for a game? he?d say ?yea let?s go?. Yea but the other two, like the other guy, David never talks in . Um, but I think it?s better because he had some ? like he would ask me ?oh how do I meet the wrestlers? and I don?t like the  formation. If I find out about free stuff he?d want to know that. It?s more that kind of stuff, to benefit.",,,,
354,395, Yeaahhh,,,,
354,396," But the guy from New York I?ve seen a few times, and he is nice workwise. But I think outside of work he wanted me to call more and text more, and I didn?t.",,,,
354,395, And hang out,,,,
354,396," So I, so I think I saw him twice since then",,,,
354,395," You sound like an alley cat, hmmm ",,,,
354,396, No I?m not,,,,
354,395, Yes you are,,,,
354,396, Nope,,,,
354,395," Yea, you need a friend ",,,,
354,396," I don?t think so. I don?t, I don?t think we have enough room.",,,,
354,396," That?s the reason and, I think I mentioned you, you complain about him getting sick, now you have two cats who could be sick. And um.",,,,
354,395, No I won?t.,,,,
354,396," There?s more. As far as the food and the litter and all that stuff, um, when the exterminator comes it?ll be a bigger mess.",,,,
354,396," We?ll have to hide them I guess. Even though I think they probably might know. But like still in the lease it says ?no pets? and um, I",,,,
354,395, Can?t you get the lease you got from like the 89 cent store or whatever?,,,,
354,396," But also, remember, he is older and he, he might have no issue, he may not even remember that, the cat thing. To be honest. Um. Like there?s some with the mess, but he like didn?t follow up. How long ago was that ? that was a while ago right?",,,,
354,395," Well he did, but, never again.",,,,
354,396," Yea so he hasn?t mentioned it since then and followed up. I think it?s because we pay, I mean we?re on time, I think we?ve been on time ? haven?t we been on time every month since you moved in or no?",,,,
354,395, Mhm,,,,
354,396," So I think that?s positive. That?s why it?s like ?ehh, forget the mess? or ?forget this, that?. The reason I found out the cats they don?t like is because when they do, I mentioned with them cleaning and fixing up, they said if there?s a cat or a dog it?s harder to fix it up. The cats and dogs leave, like, scents and leave things behind like hair. So when that happens, if we leave, when they clean up it will be hard to clean because of the cat stuff.  ",,,,
354,395," I saw a guy with a huge cat litter bag over his shoulder on the stairs, so. They have cats, the whole building has cats.",,,,
354,396," Yea I think it?s a huge, there are mostly cats, pretty much, but. It?s still, like if they don?t officially, you know. Cause it?ll be hard for us to move away from once the interview comes.  ",,,,
354,396," Yea, I think, I mean it?s, there?s no reason not to just ? also it?s harder, that?s where he sprays. He sprays by the sink, and I think, um, he sprays where the cat food is. He used to spray but the door, but I think he stopped that because your, your mess is there.",,,,
354,395,My mess or your stuff?,,,,
354,396," And he also sprays under the refrigerator too. I think I saw him do that one time. And then he goes in the bathroom and he sprays behind the toilet. And I think he sprays above, you saw that above the toilet? There?s something that",,,,
354,395, Oh that?s what that is?,,,,
354,396," I think he sprayed behind and he also sprayed the wall which, I don?t know why.",,,,
354,395, That was bad ,,,,
354,396," Remember I think I saw that mark after he left, so it must have been what happened.",,,,
354,395, Mhm,,,,
354,396," He might have, he might have even sprayed the whole wall. But then ? he doesn?t spray the hallway . I always say ? but like he looks in the hallway, I don?t think he sprays in the hallway. Even ? I know now there?s stuff there, but I used to clear that out and he wouldn?t spray.",,,,
354,395, Yea that?s weird,,,,
354,396, He sprays the kitchen and the bathroom. And he al- he always asks me ?oh how about that room? and like -,,,,
354,395, Yea,,,,
354,396," Sometimes he does, he tried it with you so you wouldn?t know",,,,
354,395, Yea,,,,
354,396," With me it?s like fifty fifty he asks sometimes he doesn?t ask. I think he?s just grinding his nose, we don?t want him. I don?t want him in there because the one time he did he got spray on my signed jersey I have, and it?s like a stain up here.",,,,
354,395, You could cover it up.,,,,
354,396," There?s just too much stuff to cover up. I mean, to be honest.  The clothes by the door I have them not do anything but their clean, I didn?t get to that point. Everything from the chair to the wall, that was, all that stuff is like cleaned and organized, but I didn?t clean from the before to this way. So um, I?m sure from the pile of clothes I could get rid of some of it and, you know, whatever you want donated ? have you donated or have you ever donated? Cause I don?t wear some of them. There are a lot of t-shirts, there are so many Mets t-shirts I don?t really wear. There?s, um, some wrestling, them I keep because there?s a lot of t-shirts and polo shirts and, um, and a lot of jackets. But you get a lot of jackets and stuff. But I?m sure if I cou- if that area there I might be able to cut it in half. Cause I think I only actually wear like half of that pile. But the problem is that wouldn?t do a lot for us. I mean it?d look nicer but . It?s as big a problem, that whole area. But I?ll try the boxes. Cause yeah the Walmart gives me big boxes at one little pop. You were saying it?s cheaper for them, I think?",,,,
354,396, Cause it doesn?t benefit me cause-,,,,
354,396," Also it?s annoying with the package I have to worry about, instead of one package I have to worry about if I ordered fifteen pops, fifteen packages .",,,,
354,395, That?s stupid.,,,,
354,396," And they come on different days, it just a mess, heh. It?s like why not just get a huge box, put them all in there.",,,,
354,395, Because it cost too much.,,,,
354,396, That?s probably why ,,,,
354,395, The weight?,,,,
354,396," But they offer free shipping for over 35, but then it?s free shipping in 10 different packages I guess. But?",,,,
354,395, Yea we should get a bigger apartment.,,,,
354,396, I?d be fine with it.,,,,
354,395, Normal closets I guess.,,,,
354,396," Well yea I definitely, um, honestly I feel cramped at times, it?s hard to get in and out. You know, like you said it?s 3 of us ? it?s me, you, Wolfie sharing, um. See the thing is I don?t know if it seems like a small space because of all of our stuff. There?s really not a lot of space for us to really roam around. We really have a limited space. Bella?s like ?I want to see Wolfie? and I have to make up an excuse, and then um. Jenny mentioned, um, I don?t know if you were there but she had mentioned ? she got a switch and she wanted to get her PS4 can um-",,,,
354,395, She got this game on the plane,,,,
354,396," Exactly, can you guys um-",,,,
354,395, No she just wanted a PS4 game and asked if she could leave it there.,,,,
354,396, I see,,,,
16,32," Honey, what?s on your mind?",,,,
16,31, What!?,,,,
16,32," What?s on your mind, honey?",,,,
16,31, Get off of me! The fuck is wrong with you?,,,,
16,32, I?m trying to figure out why you don?t trust me.,,,,
16,31," Because you do stuff that make, makes me not trust you.",,,,
16,32, Okay well I gotta tell you something.,,,,
16,31, What?,,,,
16,32, Close your eyes,,,,
16,31," Oh my god, you?re not gonna sing, they?ll hear you.",,,,
16,32, make a wi? What?,,,,
16,31, You?re the one who?s not taking it serious.,,,,
16,32," OK, what?s good with the trust issues? Like? I mean I? we talk about this every day so this is not new to me.",,,,
16,31, We really do talk about this every day.,,,,
16,32," Wh-what the fuck? Like now we volunteer, we have to talk about this shit, right now. Gimme the what.",,,,
16,31, You need to stop talking to your exes.,,,,
16,32," Nigga, you couldn?t even stop on here. Mine is to look at Facebook.",,,,
16,31, Well who?s not gonna hit up ___ on Facebook.,,,,
16,32, An-and then? every 5 minutes something goes wrong.,,,,
16,31, I hit? I inboxed Destiny one time.,,,,
16,32, You still inboxed her. You still? no she didn?t.,,,,
16,31, But then you don?t include yourself.,,,,
16,32, Y-you wanna make sure that I?m OK? You see me.,,,,
16,31, No.,,,,
16,32, Yes.,,,,
16,31, You also inbox them too.,,,,
16,32," No I? Maaaaaan, I inbox them so I?ll be able to ge-get work. It helps with a stable place so I can be a better person for you. That?s all I care about and you don?t seem to understand that. All I care is getting myself better that I could also, effectively, be a good person for you. That?s the really all I give a fuck about. You?re worried about getting cheated on, I?m worried about how the hell I?m gonna pay for school. You?re worried about whether?, I?m worried about where the fuck I?m gonna sleep. You?re worried about why I?m not picking up my phone, I?m worried about staying focused so that I can pick up my phone and talk to you on the phone in a safe place. So all these trust issues actually have nothing to do with me and everything to do with your last relationship and if you keep on associating the two, how can you wanna stay in a relationship with me?",,,,
16,31, How do I associate the two?,,,,
16,32," You keep on associating the two all the, ?wah wah that?s for you because I did it for him and it didn?t work out?. Nigga I?m not him.",,,,
16,31,How do you know?,,,,
16,32," Human beings. Homo sapien. Would you like any other, uh, any other word?",,,,
16,31," No, . I just, I don?t know",,,,
16,32, What I?m tryna say is that you say you?re no trusting somebody gonna?,,,,
16,31," Every time I try to trust you, you always do something.",,,,
16,32, That?s not true!,,,,
16,31, That?s not true?,,,,
16,32, I?ve been with a woman once or twice. I?ve messed up.,,,,
16,31, Once or twice?! Once or twice?!,,,,
16,32, Hello.,,,,
26,51," So we just need to be a little more tidy with the house. Like yesterday when I came in, there was cat throw-up on the floor still that you forgot to pick up when you went out. And there was plastic bags and the table was dirty and it just was like AH. There was a chicken bone on the floor from the cat, from the big chicken I think you took out the oven and I forgot was in there. I don?t know because the bone was red.",,,,
26,52," I, I took the bones out. He must have gotten it from the--",,,,
26,51, Well maybe it dropped on the floor?,,,,
26,52," He got that from the  the bag the chicken, yeah, no.",,,,
26,51,  The chicken? He went in the refrigerator and got it?,,,,
26,52," That wasn?t in the fridge, the chicken was out on the counter, it was on the stove.",,,,
26,51," No I?m talking about when I came in, I didn?t take the chicken out until I came in. That chicken was in a plastic bag when I left the house.",,,,
26,52," It was on the counter, I mean, it was on the, the kitchen, I?m, the stove.",,,,
26,51, No I had the chicken in the bag in the sink.,,,,
26,52," I don?t know, then they got it out of that.",,,,
26,51," And they ate it down. And the cat throw up was still on the floor. Like I should have picked it up before I left the house, and it was still there.",,,,
26,52," Washing dishes, I forget.",,,,
26,51, You washed the dishes?,,,,
26,52, And I forget. Do you believe it or not that I was washing the dishes?,,,,
26,51, I don?t buy that.,,,,
26,52, You asked me to wash them and I was washing ?em.  I looked at--,,,,
26,51,  I shouldn?t have to tell you to do anything.,,,,
26,52, Well I don?t pay attention to that stuff so if you don?t tell me I?m not gonna do it.,,,,
26,51," So you go in the kitchen, you?re gonna get something to drink, you don?t find any cups. You see ten cups in the sink, that doesn?t say ?Let me wash the dishes??",,,,
26,52, Yeah but that doesn?t happen.,,,,
26,51, Why?,,,,
26,52," No I?m saying that wasn?t how, I walked into the kitchen and there?s, uh--",,,,
26,51," So you don?t see the sink? The sink is  black and blue, black and white in the kitchen. You only see what you wanna see, I know that.",,,,
26,52, ,,,,
26,51, I?m asking ?cause the table has stuff all over on it,,,,
26,52, The table always has stuff on it.,,,,
26,51," Yeah but you could clean it off. I?m busy with the baby. I have to cook, I got up and made, like the other day, the other day I made e-eggs and grits for breakfast. Remember? And I have to get up, I have to cook, I gotta wash the dishes before I cook, wash them afterward. Do you think that?s fair? ?Cause I?m not gonna let the house go off up, uproar. But I, I see that you are. It?s just pitching in, that?s all. Like I?m feeling better now, and I can deal with it more. I?m more, you know, like, assistance with the cat throw up, that was just like still there when I walked into the apartment.",,,,
26,52, I forgot about it.,,,,
26,51," And just paper towels all over the floor and little plastic bags, and then for like days I?ve been asking you to dump the garbage out in the bathroom. And you finally did it the other day, but I?ve been asking you since last week to do it. Maybe you need to get your hearing checked. You swear you didn?t hear me ask you. No no no, not ask, tell you or aks you can you please empty out the garbage. You are the man on the house supposably. You could just pitch in a little more. I?m getting tired of asking. It?s like I?ll blow my brains out, for what? I don?t want the drama. Be there by my damn self then. Would you rather play the pretty old games? I wish you would help. It?s just like, let me help out my sweetheart. That?s all I?m simply asking for. Capiche? Are you there? Hello to [52?s name]",,,,
26,52, Yeah.,,,,
26,51," You say that but then you don?t do it. Who wants to be in a dirty relationship? You do, huh? You like dirty girls? Well I ain?t dirty. with my feet. I need a bandaid, you see that? And then the bank again. And then the washing of the clothes along with the cleaning. It?s just like AH. If you lived by yourself, would you be able to do these things? No. Sad. It?s like you?re the puppet, you?re the, I?m the mast--, the teer, whatever it?s called. Pick up this, pick up that, pick pick pick pick pick pick. Frustrating. I feel bad when people come in and they see all the stuff everywhere. It?s like Goddamn. Let Daisy come help with the room, she?ll help. ?Need help, need help?? You know she likes to pick stuff up. Just about cleaning, like, you see how this room is like airtight? Look there you have it, camera, the walls even look perfect like everything is clean and neat, that?s how I want the house to be when I walk in. I wanna walk in and see clean fresh air, I don?t wanna come in and smell rotten stuff. Like the garbage that didn?t get taken out, or there?s garbage bags in there or there?s a leftover pull-up or just, think, the sink. Tired of it. Me so tired of dirty home. Please help out more. You hear me talking to you?",,,,
26,52, Yeah.,,,,
26,51," Love this is some serious stuff. I don?t think when you go other places, your friend?s home, do they have a dirty home? No. Gotta be more responsible, it?s annoying. Just gotta clean the apartment. But hey, it was clean before I had her, and it should stay clean even though sometimes we don?t get to clean because we?re tired, but still it shouldn?t look like a hurricane category five has hit the house along with a tsunami and a mudslide and a forest fire and a campfire hit the house. That?s what it looks like. If you fix it, if you mess it clean it. Right? If you drop something pick it up! That?s not too hard to ask, or you know, this ain?t gonna work at all. Clean clean clean. That?s all I ask you to do, help with. But when I gotta ask you ten twenty thirty times, wash the dishes, take the garbage out, take, do the bathroom, clean the tub, never clean the toilet out, never clean behind the toilet, or rims the other side. When you men pee, y?all pee goes on the side too. I?m a female, my urine goes inside the toilet, not the outskirts. You might as well pee in a cup, like the Muslims do, that?s how they pee. You just don?t get it. You need to hurry up. We need to go home and we need to clean. Clean clean clean clean clean clean clean.  Anything else you would like to say, before the fifteen minutes is over with. About cleaning? Like I?ll help pitch in more?",,,,
26,52, Hmm.,,,,
26,51," Well say it, it?s recording us. I did all the fricking talking. What kind of stuff is that, hmm? Oh. Well I guess that?s over with. S are you gonna help pitch in more?",,,,
26,52, Yes.,,,,
26,51," Okay, I guess we?re done. He has nothing else to say. That?s it?",,,,
26,52, Hmm? That?s it. I mean how long can we talk about cleaning?,,,,
26,51," Well I?m trying to like make points to you and you?re supposed to say ?Well, you?re right. I?m gonna start doing this, I?m gonna start doing that, I?m gonna start doing this.? You?re sitting there, shaking. Like you got or parkinson?s. It?s just cleaning, that?s it, like clean. End debate. And some other things.  It?s probably time to change her. This is what you signed up for.",,,,
26,52, Mhmm.,,,,
26,51," A family, older woman. Okay I think our fifteen minutes is up now.",,,,
26,52, I don?t think that?s fifteen minutes.,,,,
26,51," It was like ten minutes then? And that?s, what, five minutes straight, it?s gotta be fifteen minutes now.",,,,
26,52, No.,,,,
26,51, What?,,,,
26,52, I don?t think that?s fifteen minutes.,,,,
26,51," Yeah, ?cause we talk for fifteen minutes about, um,  the issue--",,,,
26,52,"  I don?t, I won?t say that we talked for fifteen minutes.",,,,
26,51," For, I talked longer than five minutes. You just need to pitch in more with a lot of stuff. You?re the one being quiet, not me.",,,,
26,52, I?m not saying anything.,,,,
26,51, You?re supposed to say something. Like ?I?m going to help out?.,,,,
26,52, Mmm.,,,,
26,51," Yeah but you gotta say it, like.",,,,
26,52, And I already said it.,,,,
26,51, Or the question would be ?Why don?t you clean?? And you could answer that. Talk about that. Cat got your tongue?,,,,
26,52, What?,,,,
26,51, Cat got your tongue about cleaning?,,,,
26,51, You?re not talking.,,,,
26,52, I?ll do whatever.,,,,
26,51," It?s called, that?s why we came here, to participate.",,,,
26,52," I don?t, you?re the one wanted to come.",,,,
26,51, Really?,,,,
26,52, What?,,,,
26,51, Nothing. Okay we?re done.,,,,
59,118,"Okay, so have at it. ?",,,,
59,117,Can you at least zip up your fly so we can discuss it? thank you.,,,,
59,118, It is zippered up.,,,,
59,117," Oh, okay, it looked like it, sorry. Uhm?",,,,
59,117, I don?t know. ,,,,
59,118," Okay, have you thought of anything differently? I mean we-we?ve talked about this a thousand times. ",,,,
59,117, I would like to attempt to clear window space so I can at least attempt to have a plant.,,,,
59,118," Okay, we can do that ",,,,
59,117," Um?It possibly might be better off in the living room but then there?s Jake.  And I don?t know what plants are  bad or good for-well not good,  but I don?t know what plants would be, um, harmful to him.",,,,
59,118,"  Mm.  Yeah.    Yeah, that?s the thing, we can?t really put anything  anywhere other than the living room because of Jake ",,,,
59,117,  But?but I think a plant might ,,,,
59,118, Help?,,,,
59,117, Yeah.,,,,
59,118," So like, a chia pet.",,,,
59,117," No-well, sure. ",,,,
59,118, Mhm.,,,,
59,117," But there?s not enough sunlight in our bedroom, that?s why I think the living room would be ?",,,,
59,118," Well, we would just have to like lift the-the-the-the-the curtain, but that wouldn?t be a good idea.  We don?t want people to be like,  ?Look, it?s Alex and Becky?  ?Just watching T.V.?",,,,
59,117,  Mm.  Mm.,,,,
59,117," Mm, well I guess if we just put the shade down at night.",,,,
59,118," Yeah, plants can be all like ?",,,,
59,117, But it still needs to be cleared.,,,,
59,118," ?Where?s my sun?? Yeah, yeah we can clear it. The only thing that?s there right now is the, um ?",,,,
59,117, The karaoke machine.,,,,
59,118," The karaoke machine, mm. We can make a place for that.",,,,
59,117, And there?s all that stuff too there. That?s yours.,,,,
59,118, There?s also that big bag of stuff.,,,,
59,117,"Yeah, I gotta-I got, uh, I?m working on that, I?m gonna put that in-in the empty luggage.",,,,
59,118, Mm.,,,,
59,117, Umm.,,,,
59,118, I mean I?ve already kind of gotten rid of all of my worldly pleasures over the last week so ? ,,,,
59,117," Yes, I know, I?m proud of you of getting some of your stuff so we have more room.",,,,
59,118, I don?t know how much more I can get rid of.,,,,
59,117," I know, I?m not expecting you to get rid of anything else unless it?s  broken or it doesn?t work or if you have in like the laptop.",,,,
59,117," No, man.",,,,
59,118," Yeah, and we?ve been using it at work.",,,,
59,117," I?m...pretty sure there?s like five or six still, in the closet.",,,,
59,118," That should just be the two chromebooks,  your old laptop.",,,,
59,117, Why don?t you look at it over the weekend  and then let me know.,,,,
59,118,  Mhm. ,,,,
59,118, Okay.,,,,
59,117," But um?  uh, I hate New York, it?s so expensive.",,,,
59,118," Yeah. It?s unfortunate that, uh, uh...kind of, career-wise, kind of lengthier but ?but uh, yeah, I mean again, yeah, you know, let?s see what happens with the-let?s-let?s see what happens, let?s see if you work with the U.S. Marshall or whatever... um, we?ll see what the joint income looks like at that point and then we can start looking into where else we can be ",,,,
59,117,  Mhm. ,,,,
59,117," Yeah, but that job?s not forever. ",,,,
59,118," I-Once again, right now it?s just about-just working, but then once you?ve figured out-you know, once things, you know-you?re in a point in your life where you feel like things are a little more permanent as far as your appointment goes, and we can-assess. ",,,,
59,117, I guess.  What happens if-I don?t know. Just doesn?t seem like we can get a lot of value here. In terms of  what?s on the market.    ,,,,
59,118,  space. ,,,,
59,118," It?s about location, not about space. ",,,,
59,117, But I?d like the space.,,,,
59,118," Sometimes in your li-actually, I was talking to someone in the real estate, uh, business today, um, they were talking about-about the?New York, because they-you know, the reason why a lot of-uh-lot of money is going into New York real estate (scratches arm) is a lot of foreign money. Because there?s like - ",,,,
59,117, Foreign money?,,,,
59,118," Foreign money.  Uh, Chinese money, Russian money  what not. But um-so, cause they?re buying, cause like, you know, even though, let?s say New York?s not necessarily doing the best, everyone else is doing worse.",,,,
59,117,  Uh huh. Okay. ,,,,
59,117, In terms of??,,,,
59,118," Just, like, the economy, everything. So, it?s like, where else are you going to put your money? So, there?s a lot of people who are just buying up properties here, just uh, cause there?s nowhere else that they can put their money. Um, so they?re pushing up prices. That?s exchanging, cause one (counts off with fingers) you got interest rates going up. Two, with the oil price collapsing, that put pressure on like the Saudis, and Putin to start collecting all the money that they?ve kind of, you know, filtered into the US to start trying to get that back to make up for the money they?re not making in the oil ? ",,,,
59,117,"Okay, wh-wh-what?s the-what?s the-what?s the result? ",,,,
59,118," The point is, is, you know, there might be a-a slow down in New York for a bit as far as real estate goes.",,,,
59,117, Slow down doesn?t-a slow down doesn?t help in terms of a decrease. ,,,,
59,118," It might begin to decrease once interest rates go up  which will probably happen over the next couple of years. It?s already started to happen.  And on top of that, China had a rough, uh, um, you know, had some rough economic realities ?",,,,
59,117,  No.  Okay.,,,,
59,117, What did China have to do with the-uh-with the ?uh ?,,,,
59,118, They?re pulling money out of the U.S.,,,,
59,117, Oh.,,,,
59,118, So they?re limiting how much money can come into the U.S. right now.,,,,
59,117, Didn?t they just buy the plaza?,,,,
59,118, Yeah.,,,,
59,117, Well ?,,,,
59,118, But they?re not buying like 10 plazas a year.,,,,
59,117, Well what does that gotta do with rent  ?,,,,
59,118," The point is the more, the more foreign money comes with the buyer of the property just to put money in there, the more it pushes up the price of everything.",,,,
59,117, So you?re blaming this on foreigners ,,,,
59,118," No, I?m Not at all. Um, I?m saying that?s what happened ?cause of the crises. People around the world didn?t necessarily have other places to put their money so a lot of money gravitated towards buying property in places like New York City, Chicago etc...San Francisco?because they wanted to buy property but they knew interest rates would go up eventually and that was gonna hurt the real estate market. So they try to, you know, buy in places that, you know, are the least crazy.",,,,
59,117, Well it sounds like because foreigners put their money in our market that?s why rent?s so high.,,,,
59,118," It?s maybe ? It?s - it contributes to, um, a lack of development of affordable housing, I guess. Um, mainly because, basically what happens is they buy up these nice condos because they need to put the money somewhere. So you have all these empty condos sold to, you know, the arms of Putin, the Saudis, the ? um ? Chinese billionaires, the whatnot, trying to park their money because they?re afraid of their own countries having issues with the currency so they?d rather have the U.S. denominated assets. (pause) And then you know you have some also like rich Europeans but a lot less so because Europe?s having its own troubles. Ummmmm. But yeah, so it?s a lot of money filtering in New York pushing up big- the prices.  Well, you know. We don?t have to talk in general anymore, we can talk about ?",,,,
59,117, Mhm. Mhm.,,,,
59,117," No, we have to talk about the living situation. ",,,,
59,118," Well we know what the living situation is. We?re living with your mom, which is fine, in the sense, like ?",,,,
59,117, It?s fine but I?d still like our own space.,,,,
59,118," I would, I would like our own space at some point too, but you don?t want to rush into it either.",,,,
59,117," No, that?s true.",,,,
59,118," So right now, you are lacking employment. That looks like it?s gonna be fixed very soon. And once that?s the case, we can start reassessing our options. But in the meantime it?s prudent for us to stay put.",,,,
59,117, But it?s not permanent employment? ,,,,
59,118, We don?t know.,,,,
59,117, ? Then why would we get permanent housing? Which means it?s another 6 months before we make any move whatsoever.,,,,
59,118," Well, not necessarily. There?s lots of things that can change. ",,,,
59,117," Like what? You?re not mo-, you?re not changing careers. ",,,,
59,118," No, but I could be making more. First we, you know, just pick up-pick up our business and make (inaudible) some new products. I?m spending more time at work so that allows me to invest more time into those things and get those things done so that we can (inaudible).",,,,
59,117, Apparently some buildings have requirement to what you plant- have planted on your windowsill. ,,,,
59,118," Mhm. This is New York, it isn?t any state.",,,,
59,117," Oh, bulls***. Some bulls***",,,,
59,118," You know what you should do? You should  run for city council. You can, you can take it up with the Libertarian party convention in May and you can voice your wanting to run against Jumaane Williams.  (Inaudible)",,,,
59,117,"  Nope - Oh.  Anyway, that?s another job I applied to. ",,,,
59,118, You applied to city council?,,,,
59,117, To work for them.,,,,
59,118, Oh.,,,,
59,117, But anyway ?,,,,
59,18," But then they turned you down and you?re like screw it I?m gonna run for your office, Jumaane ",,,,
59,117,"Um, I don?t know, it?s in Bedstuy anyway ? meh. ",,,,
59,118, Mhm or you could run for mayor ?,,,,
59,117, Okay you?re getting off topic. ,,,,
59,118, Okay. But then you get to live in a big ? Gracie mansion. ,,,,
59,117, I don?t wanna live in a Gracie mansion. ,,,,
59,118, It?s a lot more space. ,,,,
59,117, There?s too many people around there.,,,,
59,118, Okay -,,,,
59,117, And I can?t do  and I can?t change the price-I think it?s near City Hall. ,,,,
59,118,  Where is Gracie mansion anyway. ,,,,
59,118," Oh so you just , okay.",,,,
59,117,  Huh?,,,,
59,118, So you can literally just walk over.,,,,
59,117," Yeah I guess. So anyway ? but, no, because I can?t even change stuff. Because of city property. Like you can?t paint the wall. ",,,,
59,118, I?m sure you can have a plant. ,,,,
59,117,"Probably but still probably has to ? I?m sure there?s some type of  in Manhattan. And that?s another thing, New York City, like, even if you get a house, like, like I think Larry Shuck did, there are no property rights in New York City.",,,,
59,118," Mhm. Wait, did you hear the podcast with him about this or -? ",,,,
59,117, No! You said that many times before. Yeah.,,,,
59,118," I don?t know, I?m just wondering when-when you ?",,,,
59,117, At Big Daddy?s! Anyway. ,,,,
59,118," Oh, well, yeah.",,,,
59,117, So ,,,,
59,118, Did they podcast.,,,,
59,117, You?re getting off topic.,,,,
59,118," Sorry, I don?t know what else to say. We?ve had this conversation so many times. ",,,,
59,117, When will it get better?,,,,
59,118, When it gets better. Well you might as well enjoy what you have now because you never know it might get worse first. ,,,,
59,117, Well I?m just concerned I will never get to enjoy what I would like in terms of  having our own space ,,,,
59,118,  No one - ,,,,
59,118," No one ever has perfection. The point is taking what you have now, enjoying it, and working towards what you want. You know, because once you get there it?s kinda boring because you got there. It?s the journey the- it?s the journey that?s the fun part. You know it?s like when you play the videogames it?s not fun when you beat it, it?s fun as you?re playing it. When you get there you?re just kinda like, ?What do I do now?? Kinda like Grim the other day, we finished Grim and you?re just kinda like ?okay?. But the fun was all the seasons of watching how it got to that point.",,,,
59,117, (Tapping the armrest) It?s not fun to be stuck in one place hoping that at some point we?ll be in another place. In reality video games are different.,,,,
59,118,  Well there?s so much else ?,,,,
59,118, There?s so much else to life other than where you live though. ,,,,
59,117, We could have more social gatherings if we had our own place.,,,,
59,118, Depends where the place is.,,,,
59,117, We could save money.,,,,
59,118, We could go get a place probably in Staten Island but no one -,,,,
59,117, I don?t wanna move to Staten Island because I know no one will come ?,,,,
59,118, If you wanna - if we move out of New York City?,,,,
59,117, I wouldn?t even go to Staten Island if I loved it there. ,,,,
59,118," ?No one would wanna go there. But if we moved out of New York City like you want, no one would come  ?",,,,
59,117, We?d make new friends.,,,,
59,118, Okay but you?re-you know you?re always concerned about making new friends. ,,,,
59,117, Fair enough.,,,,
59,118, I mean I have no problem with that but?,,,,
59,117, I don?t know about George anymore ?cause that bridge fell down,,,,
59,118," Yeah George is a little bit, uh,  A bit of trouble right now. ",,,,
59,117, Yeah.,,,,
59,118," Man, homeless people with their fires. ",,,,
59,117, Mhm. Anyway,,,,
59,118," The world is a little crazy right now so, you know, now just rocking the boat is not probably necessarily the most horrible decision. ",,,,
59,117, Yeah.,,,,
59,118, You can run for president,,,,
59,117, You?re getting off topic!,,,,
59,118, No ?cause it?s a living situation change.,,,,
59,117, I don?t wanna move to the White House!,,,,
59,118, Oh. ,,,,
59,117, Why? Because there will be people on my lawn. I can?t tell them to get off my lawn because technically it?s their lawn too. ,,,,
59,118, I think there are studies where you can live on an Island for a year?,,,,
59,118, ?And they pay you like six figures to live on an island for a year by yourself.,,,,
59,117," I don?t wanna live on an island. I don?t, like ?",,,,
59,118," There?s no people, which is one of the things that you don?t like. Um. You-you could probably do all the reading you want, which you like. ",,,,
59,117, It would probably be quiet.,,,,
59,118, Mhm. And there would be water and trees.,,,,
59,117, What studies are these? ,,,,
59,118, I don?t know -,,,,
59,117, And that?s not a permanent solution.,,,,
59,118," Nothing is a permanent solution! Life?s not a permanent solution.  You know, so everything?s temporary. You just try to make the best of it. (pause) So much baby powder on my shoes. ",,,,
59,117, I would like to ? you?re getting off topic ? I would like to throw a Halloween party at some point?,,,,
59,118, We can throw a?,,,,
59,117, ?we?d get to host it- What? ,,,,
59,118, We could always ? there are different ways to throw a Halloween party?,,,,
59,117, Where?,,,,
59,118," ?we could, we could see if a bar would let us or uh ?",,,,
59,117, You probably have to pay them like uh rental coverage.,,,,
59,118, Depends. more than likely they?ll let you throw a party there if it means you?re gonna bring people there to go drink and then they?re probably  more conveniently located.,,,,
59,117,  But that requires getting to know a bar that will allow it.,,,,
59,118, You can just call around and you know ?,,,,
59,117," And there might be other d*****bags there too who you know might ruin the party. Like I want to throw a party, I don?t wanna have a party outside in a public place.",,,,
59,118," You could also, if you know anybody who has enough space, you can also see if they?ll let you throw a party at their place. They would.",,,,
59,117, There was one time a nice lady. ,,,,
59,118, Mhm.,,,,
59,117," Jane, but, you know I really shouldn?t share that. Umm.",,,,
59,118, Well I mean like think about everyone we know doesn?t have a huge space in New York City. ,,,,
59,117, No but even like a decent space I?ve been in a few apartments that had decent space. Like even where Dave and Dianna live.,,,,
59,118,  There?s probably spaces.,,,,
59,118, Yeah.,,,,
59,117, That?s a decent space.,,,,
59,118, But who would we really invite to this place anyways? ,,,,
59,117," Anthony, Rob, Angela ?",,,,
59,118," Anthony?s just gonna wanna  like, be angry",,,,
59,117,  Angela?s moving back to Brooklyn ?,,,,
59,118,  Angela?s gonna have a baby ,,,,
59,117,  Who cares? ,,,,
59,117, I just always wanted to throw a Halloween party. ,,,,
59,118, Okay. ,,,,
59,117, But also ,,,,
59,118,  When are we gonna have kids?,,,,
59,118, ?Cause we are ?,,,,
59,117,"You?re getting off to- Oh, oh, that?s another reason to move out. You want kids so badly, so we can have space for kids.",,,,
59,118," Kids don?t need a lot of space, they?re small ",,,,
59,117," Well, no! ",,,,
59,118," Um, if a lot of other people can do it I?m sure we can make it work, we can make it work. Again, once we have our- once we figure out what our joint- what our combined incomes are gonna look like, down the road, we-we?ll see what works. You know. (Long pause) You know, I mean I don?t know what?s (inaudible) it?s not like-it?s, you know, magic money is going to pop out of nowhere. ",,,,
59,117, What?,,,,
59,118," It?s not like we?re gonna have like-you know, have a magical fund that?s gonna make themselves magically appear.",,,,
59,117, It would?ve been nice if my father invested more in his life insurance.,,,,
59,118, Well ?,,,,
59,117, I?m just saying.,,,,
59,118, Your father wasn?t necessarily the most prudent investor in the world. Actually he was maybe too prudent of an investor.  Um. But uh.,,,,
59,117,Cause that would?ve helped. ,,,,
59,118, Of course. There?s plenty of things your father could?ve done that would?ve helped,,,,
59,117,  Yeah.,,,,
59,118, Not that he did too much to not help. ,,,,
59,117, No no no. I feel like I would have had a better opportunity of having my own space now if my parents moved out of that one bedroom apartment  I feel like there?s a little bit of cause and effect there,,,,
59,118,  Of course but that-that?s a different life you didn?t have.,,,,
59,117," No,  but I still feel like there?s a little bit of cause and effect there. ",,,,
59,118,  Yeah ,,,,
59,118," I mean I could imagine all sorts of things that could have happened in the past that would have made my life different, but that?s not what happened. You know, what I could do is make with what did happen. ",,,,
47,94,  We need this discussion.,,,,
47,93," We need money ?cause this week was rough.  Rent is sky high, without money, we don?t got noting.  Wanna be homeless?  ",,,,
47,94,  Right.  Yeah.,,,,

47,93,  Mhm.,,,,
47,93, Yeah.,,,,
47,94," Hell, avoid a lot of problems,  you know. Even though I still be worried, you know, about one thing",,,,
47,93,  Alright.  Right.  ,,,,
47,93, I?m gonna take it with me because I?m gonna have it right in my stash.,,,,
47,94,Somebody gonna take it.,,,,
47,93, Mm-mmm.,,,,
47,94, Yeah.,,,,
47,93," I write a will, nothing on me, make sure I have this amount of money in my stash.  So when I go in the ground, it?s there.  All sweaty and wrinkly and all that.",,,,

47,93," Yeah,  of heaven. It gonna be glow-in-the-dark money.",,,,
47,94, It ain?t gonna go with you.,,,,
47,93, I?m keeping it in my stash.  Just like with my ?,,,,
47,93, You trying to say it?s gonna be all saggy and stuff?,,,,
47,94, You don?t need it.,,,,
47,93, I-How about if I get plastic surgery and get fake boobs they?d be  ..,,,,
47,94,"  It ain?t there ? it ain?t gonna be there. You-you gone, like ?",,,,
47,93, I?ll put it in my sock.,,,,
47,94,  You ain?t gonna have one then.,,,,
47,93, Why not?,,,,
47,94, They don?t have them wearing socks then.,,,,
47,93, I?ll put in in my pants.  And I?ll make sure I have slacks.,,,,
47,94,"  They-They?re gonna search you. Like, through your legs, you know. Like,  ",,,,
47,93,"  I-I know, you how they did DMX ? the guy that paid  for DMX, um, they buried him, threw him right in the fire and took his shirt off.",,,,
47,94," Right, you know, money ?  money is  definitely money, need money, you know. It-it-it helps. But then it causes a lot of problems, too. A lot of worryings come with it.",,,,
47,93,  I was there all.,,,,
47,93, That is why I?m tattooing a hundred dollar bill on my feet when I?m dead.,,,,
47,94," Eh, if you wanna do that, it doesn?t mean-you know, whatever, whatever, whatever. My  will always, you know, but when you look at it for the real, like, psh, money ? money causes ?",,,,
47,93, Jealousy and angry and all that.,,,,
47,94, Yeah. ,,,,
47,93,  But you gotta have it to get through.,,,,
47,93," Mm.  can?t eat, can?t fake live, can?t do nothing.",,,,
47,94," Nothing, nothing,  nothing, nothing,  myself. When I think about that, I know we have disagreements about it, but it?s not even about money that we are disagreeing this about but it?s more of ?",,,,
47,93,  But we have to.,,,,
47,93, It?s not enough.,,,,
47,94," Yeah, it?s never enough, mm. And then, how it?s like, budgeting it, you know, we have to discuss how to make everything count, you know what I mean? For something, it?s not only just spending it just to spend it,  you know, it?s ?oh no, we did this because of this.? ?We had to do that because of that.? You know?",,,,
47,93,  Right.,,,,
47,93, Right.,,,,
47,94," To-to help out with this situation, to move us from this point to that point. Um..I mean, I know it?s hard. We?ve been doin it from day one. ",,,,
47,93,"  make them how.  Some way, somehow.",,,,
47,94,  Mm,,,,
47,94,  That kind of   better find to the state.,,,,
47,93," Yeah, it?s going to get better.",,,,
47,94," Yeah, it can?t, it can?t get no worse , with determination, we too determined that like it can?t get any worse than where it is for us .",,,,
47,93,"  If you listen to me, cause once you have it, it?s gone and that?s what it is.",,,,
47,94," Yeah,  how that is , remember how I, I expressed to you that, that we?re free , but it?s going to cost you something, it may not be in value, like dollar value, but it costs something so. Like today, they tax us to print money on paper, you know, they tax people to pro--produce money  and they tax you to spend it, they tax you to store it. Like if you want to save it, they tax you, so it?s like money is, money controls  everything and it all starts with money. That?s why people are striving to get so much of it at one time, all the time, and those are usually the people that  commit suicide because they never had a lot. You give them too much and they?re gonna OD on it. The other one is, a person with everything gets bored   trial  they got so much money and  they don?t need no more so they now just doing it just because they got a lot of it, in a way, giving in to everything, their head is gonna get into everything, and they wind up ending it when they can?t have it with along, with financial stability.  there comes, there comes a problem with it, it?s not money, it?s not something, you say, ?I got money, I got no problems,? no, no, no, no, no, no,  a person with more money than the average person, they got more problems than the average person, cause now they got worries, they can?t sleep  because someone will try to take it and you know, they can?t go out and enjoy to sit in the park, they smell flowers, they can?t do it because people ?Oh, that?s a billionaire,? you know, they?re pointing their fingers at them and it?s like, ?Oh my god,? they can?t live so that?s why I say I don?t want to be rich, that?s why I say I want to be comfortable you know, ok, we don?t have to stress , you know what I mean? Stuff like that is just to get us  like money is this,  without money it?s not, money is more, more love, but yeah, that?s where we at .",,,,
47,93,"   I, I know I ain?t free  Mhm   everything  right right",,,,
47,93, I?m tired. ,,,,
47,94,"   we clearly, we gonna be alright, we?ll be alright . I just say we gonna be alright,  we just gotta keep our determination , head up.  I know we can and face it for what is  and just get through it.  Basically, all we can do , I know one thing, we?re not, I?m not going to do, I?m not going to allow our own financial issues to be a reason that we?re  that we don?t exist no more, you know what I mean, as a chain, we?re chained to this though, you know, you know, or should I say ruler when it comes to this, this is a fifty fifty thing. Yeah, sometimes I may have to jump up and say I?ll take eighty percent of it, right now we do eighty percent of it, you know, and sometimes, I got to sit down and let you do, take care eighty percent of it cause it?s a balance thing, keep us, keep us balanced, well I?m just, I?m just saying. When I can?t, I know you want to figure it out, so it?s a lot better for me, I got you, I care, a lot more than a lot of people could say.  I know this is not the first thing you  problem, I said after everything  but you got everything  I?ve been thinking about this.",,,,
47,93,    right  right  yeah,,,,
47,93,  You don?t have to depend on nobody to run this no plane.,,,,
47,94," You know I thought about it, you like a whole . I?m in love with the truck thing, you like, ?Oh, it?s a truck,? I don?t know, I?ve been thinking, do I want to get a truck or do I want to get something different because the truck is kind of .",,,,
47,93,"  You drive it, I feel like the truck will help out with you and your brother?s business thing.",,,,
47,94," Mhm. Yeah, I thought that too.  I don?t know   past .",,,,
47,93, You going to call  for good?,,,,
47,94,"  We travel too much though, so we , we,  we gotta get this thing together, we travel too much.    I?d like to see and do different things.",,,,
47,93,  Mmm,,,,
47,93, I get bored too fast.,,,,
47,94,"  it doesn?t bother me because, at least, by the time you get two bow, with the area or certain things, we pull on   that?s why we, we always    I want the plan, to keep it coming. It?s the only thing  Uhhh, I should have worn my jacket, I don?t know what was I thinking.",,,,
47,93,right,,,,
47,93, You probably didn?t think it was cold outside and cold in here.,,,,
47,94,"  a bottle of water, that?s why I?m glad , a bottle of water.",,,,
47,93, What water?,,,,
47,93, Oh. It?s no longer a see  around here.,,,,
47,94," This, this, this .",,,,
47,93, Ok.,,,,
47,94,"  We still,  I have things to do and the value of being  things we gotta do and things we want to do. ",,,,
47,93," Just send the money, that?s what she wants. You probably don?t need .",,,,
47,94," Probably not.   No, actually not. Likely not. But first she?s saying he needs schools clothes, then she?s saying, ?Oh, oh, he wearing a uniform, so you don?t gotta about, you don?t gotta worry about that,? they just need money, he just needs two pair of sneakers, alright  and where you going to send the money, or so obsessed about money.",,,,
47,93,  Hm.,,,,
47,93, Well. ,,,,
60,120, Why do I feel nervous.,,,,
60,119, Okay.,,,,
60,120," Yep, moving.",,,,
60,119," Um?I guess, we haven?t discussed it as much? I mean, there?s not much to discuss. You?re going to Maryland and I?m moving back to Taiwan.",,,,
60,120, Yeah.,,,,
60,120, Um.,,,,
60,119, Maybe we should?ve picked a different topic.,,,,
60,120," I talked to you, we just talked about this like  you know, inevitable.",,,,
60,119,  I know.,,,,
60,119," I know. Oh gosh, I?m gonna start crying.",,,,
60,120," Yeah, I?m gonna have to talk about...um?you okay? If you?re",,,,
60,119," I know, I regretted it the second I said it.",,,,
60,120," I mean I?ve thought, you know?I mean, I guess I don?t know what to actually talk about. This kind of sens ? well, not really, but I mean, ob-obviously I want you to move with me, but?",,,,
60,119, Yeah.,,,,
60,120, Mhm.,,,,
60,119, Just keep talking,,,,
60,120," Well, I don?t know what to say. I want you to come with me, but?",,,,
60,119," Let?s talk about your apartment. How are you gonna decorate it? Are you, like ?",,,,
60,120," Um, I don?t know.",,,,
60,119," Are you gonna get a studio ? like, you?re gonna live with a roommate?",,,,
60,120," I might try to avoid roommates, well ? I feel like it might be difficult because I don?t know anyone in the city. At the same time, I kind of want ?",,,,
60,119," It like, kinda sucks. ",,,,
60,120, Yeah.,,,,
60,119," But also they have those 6-month leases so maybe you can live with someone for 6 months, get to know the city and like a few people from there, um,  and then, like, get another 6 month lease or something, you know. ?Cause also you just need 6 months, like ? for us, th-our apartment now, I feel like if we had a 6-months lease, I would?ve moved after 6 months.",,,,
60,120,  That?s true.,,,,
60,120," The thing is like, 6-months lease is like?I think for me at least, I like getting that like, routine, so then I?d have to switch my routine in 6 months.",,,,
60,119," Yeah. I mean, if you like it that?s fine ? that?s another 6-months lease,  that?s what I?m saying. And like, did he say there was a difference between  finding a longer lease? It?s cheaper?",,,,
60,120,  Yeah.  I think it?s more ? It?s more expensive ?,,,,
60,120, It?s cheaper for a longer lease.,,,,
60,119," Right, that makes sense.",,,,
60,120, But I mean ?  I mean ?,,,,
60,119, Do you have extra tissues?,,,,
60,120, Do I? If not you can use my napkin. If you?re okay with my  used tissues.,,,,
60,119, I just need to blow my nose real quick.,,,,
60,120, Um?can?t see that. Um?,,,,
60,119, Yes they can.,,,,
60,120, No they can?t.,,,,
60,119, These are cameras.,,,,
60,120," These are-these are like, projectors I thought. Oh, these are cameras.",,,,
60,119, I?m pretty sure they?re cameras.,,,,
60,120, I want one of those.,,,,
60,119, They?re judging the back of your head  ,,,,
60,120, My receding hairline.,,,,
60,120," Um?I?m sure I?ll find friends. Maybe I should get roommates. If anything, I know that there?s a lot of people that work in that building, so?",,,,
60,119," Yeah. Yeah, and that building seems like a chill place ?cause it?s got like, um?a game room and stuff ? like  you could always just ?",,,,
60,120,"  Oh, that building.",,,,
60,120," I?m talking about my office building ? like, if I meet coworkers ?",,,,
60,119," Oh yeah, for sure. You-you?ll be like, having lunch in the cafeteria.",,,,
60,120, There?s no cafeteria there.,,,,
60,119," Or you could just like talk to your neighbor, and be like, ?Yo, you guys getting lunch together??",,,,
60,120," Well yeah, I?m gonna be part of a team, so?",,,,
60,119," Oh yeah, I?m sure you guys are gonna have ?team-bonding? stuff.",,,,
60,120, Team-bond happy hour? Maybe they?ll try and haze me?,,,,
60,119,Maybe you shouldn?t get wasted like  ,,,,
60,120, I won?t though.,,,,
60,119," Oh wait, back to moving and apartments. I?m excited for you, though. I love moving to new apartments.",,,,
60,120, What can you do to stay? Is there anything you can do?,,,,
60,119,"Not really?I wish. I mean, I can come back in like a year.",,,,
60,120," You should. I mean, I have like ? well I don?t know when I?m gonna start. I have like 20 ?",,,,
60,119," It seems like you have a lot of time. I feel like they?re gonna make you start like, June 15th ?cause it?s  almost June already.",,,,
60,120,  But ? but that wouldn?t work though.,,,,
60,120, June 15th?,,,,
60,119," ?Cause then you have your vacation. But then you can, again ?",,,,
60,120," But June 15th? My vacation?s on June 16th, so, I don?t think that ?",,,,
60,119," That?s what I?m saying, yeah, so like you should talk to them and be like, ?How about I start after I come back from the vacation? That would give me enough time to find an apartment, move?? and then if they say yes to that, then ask for like, relocation fees or ? and then if they say no to that ? at least you have, like,  the timing,  which is the most important over moving.",,,,
60,120,"  Well, I don?t know.  The vacation is like..",,,,
60,120," Also because my parents bought the tickets before I got the job, so I?m gonna come to New York City to fly out anyways, so it makes more sense if I just ?",,,,
60,119, You can call to change.,,,,
60,120, Hm?,,,,
60,119," You can call to change where you?re leaving from. It might be like, a hundred dollars more.",,,,
60,120," Well, I don?t know. But like ?",,,,
60,119, You could also stay here until June ?,,,,
60,120," Yeah, so I was  either?them or do that.",,,,
60,119,"  Yeah, if-if you have the time, yeah.",,,,
60,120," But then, then I?d start in like, July or  like, late June ?",,,,
60,119,  Or?,,,,
60,119," Yeah, you can start in July. Like, what?re you gonna do?",,,,
60,120," I don?t know. But I-I?m just thinking about it. If I start after, I still have-I?ll have 20 vacation days.",,,,
60,119," Yeah, exactly. Like, it sucks that you?re immediately ? like one, it looks bad, and two ?",,,,
60,120," Yeah, Jane  just mention-mentioned earlier, like, why would I burn through like three of my vacation days right when I start?",,,,
60,119,"  You?re wasting ? Yeah, exactly.",,,,
60,120,  Show ?you?re the weakest person? thing.,,,,
60,119, And also it just looks  bad.,,,,
60,120,"  Looks bad, yeah.",,,,
60,119," Like, ?Oh shit, he?s here, now he already wants a vacation??",,,,
60,120," Well, I mean I already ?",,,,
60,119," I know, you already told them but like, higher management might not know, your team members ? they?re not gonna tell every single person.",,,,
60,120," ?Where?s the new guy?? ?Oh, he went to? ?",,,,
60,119, ?He?s in Costa Rica.?,,,,
60,119," ?He couldn?t handle two days of training.?  It would look really ? it would look pretty bad, just, I think, the rest is just, once you get a reply to see if you can change the starting date.",,,,
60,120, Mhm.,,,,
60,119," ?Cause it was not even in the contract, right, your starting date? So I?m sure it?s negotiable.",,,,
60,120, Mhm.,,,,
60,119, Negotiatable.,,,,
60,120," Negotiatable-negotiable. Mm, prolonged. Yeah, I mean ?",,,,
60,119, Have you thought about how you want to decorate your apartment?,,,,
60,120, Nope. Well ?,,,,
60,119," ?Cause you won?t have like, a couch, unless you?re taking it. And if you?re taking our bed ?",,,,
60,120," I mean, I will leave the bed if you don?t have a bed.",,,,
60,119," I mean, you can take the bedframe. I don?t need that.",,,,
60,120, You need the storage space.,,,,
60,119, I don?t need it. I won?t need it. I?ll have your closet now. And I?ll just keep stuff in the bathroom. It?s only one month.,,,,
60,120," Yeah I mean I?m gonna get a bedframe though because I need the ? I need to see how big the place is  and like, what kind of bed I can fit inside.",,,,
60,119,  True.,,,,
60,119, Don?t check your phone.,,,,
60,120, Huh?,,,,
60,119, I thought you were checking your phone.,,,,
60,120, Oh.,,,,
60,119, I?m so hungry.,,,,
60,120," Yeah, we were  you know?",,,,
60,119,  There probably won?t be food- enough time to eat food.,,,,
60,120, We can go to Papaya King.,,,,
60,119, I don?t want a hot dog.  ,,,,
60,120, Where do you want to eat?,,,,
60,119, I don?t know. All you can eat sushi.,,,,
60,120, Johnson?s.,,,,
60,119," Oh, man. Let?s do your birthday free stuff.",,,,
60,120, Want to?,,,,
60,119, You get a free sandwich from Au Bon Pain.,,,,
60,120, Au Bon Pain? How about I?ll meet you at Metro Tech ?,,,,
60,119, Le Pain Quotidien?,,,,
60,120, I?ll meet you at Metro Tech after class.,,,,
60,119, After class? I?m hungry!,,,,
60,120," Alright, um. Yeah I?ll probably just put like my bed somewhere and my computer.",,,,
60,119, So you?re taking the desk.,,,,
60,120, I?ll probably put a T.V. so I can lay in bed and watch T.V. at the same time.,,,,
60,119, Lame.,,,,
60,120, Mm. It?s just ?,,,,
60,119, It?s so bad for you to have a T.V. in your bedroom. Bad feng shui.,,,,
60,120, Okay.,,,,
60,119, But it is bad. Like you?re just gonna?,,,,
60,120, Be in bed all day,,,,
60,119, ?be in bed all day. Like and if you wanna watch T.V. you have to watch it in bed.,,,,
60,120, I guess that?s true.,,,,
60,119," And if you want people to come over to game, it?s like, ?come into my bedroom.? ",,,,
60,120,"No, I took the small T.V. I?d put the small TV  ",,,,
60,119," Oh, that like retro  T.V. from your kitchen?",,,,
60,120,  No!,,,,
60,120, It?s not retro- what? It?s like basically a flat screen.,,,,
60,119,Oh. In my head it was ?,,,,
60,120, Like a box T.V.?,,,,
60,119,"I thought.  I don?t know, in my head that?s what it looked like.  Like, in a cabinet.",,,,
60,120,"No.  Nope, not like that, nope.",,,,
60,120, In the cabinet?,,,,
60,119, Vintage  vintage cabinet.,,,,
60,120,  It won?t fit in the cabinet.,,,,
60,119," Oh, built-in ?",,,,
60,120," It?s not built-in, but like, a cabinet has a space made for a T.V.",,,,
60,119, They don?t want a T.V. anymore?,,,,
60,120, They don?t need it. They have too many T.V.s in the house  They just put a T.V. ?,,,,
60,119,  Aww.,,,,
60,119, Oscar watches it.,,,,
60,120," No, but they just put a huge T.V. in the living room so?yeah. I?m gonna have a T.V. in my  bedroom.",,,,
60,119,  And you?re gonna have all the plants.,,,,
60,120," Oh, yeah, I guess.",,,,
60,119, I mean I threw away all the vegetables that I?m growing besides the avocados. You can keep that.,,,,
60,120, Okay. Thanks.,,,,
60,119, I wanna know how it?s doing.,,,,
60,120, Okay.  I?ll send you pictures.,,,,
60,119,  Umm.,,,,
60,119," Palm tree, the red flower, the lily-the peace lily, mushroom, aloe vera  Hope they?ll be beautiful.",,,,
60,120,  Wow.,,,,
60,120, Maybe I should get a couch. I like the table too.,,,,
60,119," Couches are super cheap. Just get one on Craig?s list, it?s like 100. Or just like ? you have your car, drive around.  You could, like, dumpster dive.",,,,
60,120,"  Well I might not have a car, it depends.",,,,
60,120, I wanna get a PS4.,,,,
60,119, Okay.,,,,
60,120," Eh,  ",,,,
60,119,  Are you gonna keep all my Xbox stuff or should I sell my Xbox? I?ll make like $100. And the Wii.,,,,
60,120," You could probably sell it all. You wanna start selling that stuff? Wait, we should probably talk about moving. They?re gonna look at the ?",,,,
60,119," I mean, that is moving.  Selling stuff,  packaging stuff.  Is this what they meant by moving? That?s what I was trying ? I don?t know. All these questions are worded weirdly.  I don?t know. I had to ask her to define a word for me.",,,,
60,120,"  Oh, is it?   They?re gonna watch this  I know right?",,,,
60,120, Vigorous?,,,,
60,119, No  I know what vigorous means.,,,,
60,120,  Oh.,,,,
60,120, Which one?,,,,
60,119, Indebted.,,,,
60,120, Indebted? ,,,,
60,119, What?s debt?,,,,
60,120, Does that mean you-you?re  in debt to someone?,,,,
60,119,  I?m joking.,,,,
60,119," Yeah, like I owe you or like,  I don?t know what that-I didn?t know what it meant so I asked her.  ",,,,
60,120,"  Oh, okay.",,,,
60,120, What does vigorous mean?  Vigorous is like ?,,,,
60,119,  Vigorous is like ?,,,,
60,120," Is like, very ?",,,,
60,119, It?s like a vigorous river?,,,,
60,120," Vigorous is like  it says fast, right?",,,,
60,119,"  Vigorous, like fast, angry, vigorous?",,,,
60,120," Oh well, I don?t know.",,,,
60,119," I don?t know, it makes me think of a river that?s like ?",,,,
60,120, It makes me think of skyrooms at ,,,,
60,119,Vigorous?  Like life.,,,,
60,120,  That?s um ? that?s um--,,,,
60,120, That?s .  Vigor ?  I don?t know. I just wanna ? in they have portions that are called ?vigorous health? portions.,,,,
60,119,"  Vigor is life, right?  Lively? Maybe it?s lively?",,,,
60,120," I think I put too much. Moving, moving. What?re you gonna do when you get home?",,,,
60,119," Taiwan? I?m gonna be living in our apartment, which is super nice but I wanna get my own place because the whole place was designed by my mom.",,,,
60,120, The apartment was designed by your mom?,,,,
60,119, Yes.,,,,
60,120, But the decorative ?,,,,
60,119," Yeah, like the decoration, interior design, and like, some other things. Like, we would have two balconies and she moved one in so I could have my own private bathroom. Um?",,,,
60,120," Do your parents have other places to rent out, or?are they gonna live there or?",,,,
60,119," Yeah, so my mom?s already there. She?s going through like, meditation retreat which is pretty cool for her. Um?",,,,
60,120, Interesting. What about work?,,,,
60,119," So, with work, I?m also looking ? my dad wants me to apply to jobs in Dubai. Which I need to do,  I should?ve done that two days ago.",,,,
60,120,"  Well, would you want to live in Dubai?",,,,
60,119, That would be pretty chill.,,,,
60,119," At least ? no, I don?t really like Dubai or  the people there.  Basically.",,,,
60,120,  Then you can live in like ?,,,,
60,120," Yeah, you ? it?s basically Saudi.",,,,
60,119, Basically.,,,,
60,119," And  it?s very ? and I can?t like, chill, like here in New York I love going out in my pajamas, like I won?t?  be able to do that in Dubai. They?ll be like ? they?ll think I?m like ?",,,,
60,120,"  But even more rich.  Yeah, it?d be like ?",,,,
60,120," But can you ? do you have to wear, like ?",,,,
60,119," Oh yeah, you have to at least cover all the ? I don?t think you can walk around with a crop top.",,,,
60,120, Why don?t you just work in Taiwan?,,,,
60,119," Yeah, I might just work in Taiwan.",,,,
60,120, Why don?t you apply to like ?,,,,
60,119," I kinda want to work in Japan, too. I mean, the main focus is like, I don?t want to jump ahead and just be like, ?I want to do this, I want to do that.? I just, like, let me go back to Taiwan, and be like?",,,,
60,120, Settle down.,,,,
60,119," ?Settle ? yeah, exactly. And then have a starting point, which here, I?m kinda still like, not even at a starting point.",,,,
60,120," Well. If you work somewhere like ? if you work in Taiwan or Japan, maybe just like work at Morgan Stanley for a couple of years and transfer to the United States if you want.",,,,
60,119, Taiwan?s super small. I don?t think I wanna stay there for more than a year.,,,,
60,120, Yeah? Japan ?,,,,
60,119," Their food is amazing, though.  I can?t wait to be full of the ",,,,
60,120,  Japan should be fun.,,,,
60,120, Japan has like?sushi?,,,,
60,119, Sushe.,,,,
60,120, Japan would be super fun.,,,,
60,119, Right? But then  ,,,,
60,120,  It?s just that there?s a huge language barrier.,,,,
60,119, Exactly!,,,,
60,120, But I love that.,,,,
60,119, But I feel like Japan would have more international companies than  Taiwan.,,,,
60,120,  Taiwan has a lot ?,,,,
60,119," Taiwan has a lot but they?re small.  Like it has a Google, it has HDC, it has Line which is like a Whatsapp.",,,,
60,120,  They?re all banks.,,,,
60,120, It?s all tech and banks.,,,,
60,119, Pretty much.,,,,
60,120, Same in Japan.,,,,
60,119," But also, I don?t know, ugh. Everyone is so like old-fashioned there.",,,,
60,120, I thought Taiwan is super liberal.,,,,
60,119, Yeah it?s super liberal for an Asian country.,,,,
60,120, Oh.,,,,
60,119," I mean compared to New York City, like that?s what I mean. I?m comparing everything to New York City now just because this is where I wanna stay, but? I mean they?re super liberal and super nice. At least I?m not going to, like, mainland China or something.",,,,
60,120," You mean like, Saudi?",,,,
60,119," Or Saudi, back to Saudi. Um? Yeah, exactly. So it?s pretty chill.",,,,
60,120, Pretty chill.,,,,
60,119, And I know they?ll have lots of good food.,,,,
60,120, I?m jealous. I?ll get crab at least in Maryland.,,,,
60,119, Oh yummy.,,,,
60,120, That?s all they have. Crab and like? seafood. you should definitely come and visit.,,,,
60,119, I?m so hungry.,,,,
60,120," Come visit for like, a month.",,,,
60,119," What would I do there? Catch crabs? I meant fishing!  For the record, I meant fishing.",,,,
60,120, Fishing for crabs. That?d be fun.,,,,
60,119," I don?t know, what-what Maryland? Maryland",,,,
60,120, You could hang out with like Khaled in D.C ?,,,,
60,119, Who?,,,,
60,120, Khaled.,,,,
60,119," Your frie- Oh, Khaled! I thought you were saying Collin. Why would I go see your family friend  that I barely know?",,,,
60,120,  Colon?,,,,
60,120, Colon?,,,,
60,119, Colon?,,,,
60,120, Collon?,,,,
60,120, No Khaled ?,,,,
60,119," Yeah I could go see Khaled. But then in Virginia like ? what? Virginia. I could just come back when you?re done with work. You?re probably gonna be staying late. You have to like, leave early, stay late? first ? at least the first two weeks of your work.",,,,
60,120, Staying late makes you look silly. Like being that- that guy that tries ? I mean I understand ?,,,,
60,119, I think you have to just go early at least.,,,,
60,120, I?ll show up there like 30 ? 20 minutes early.,,,,
60,119, Yeah 20-30 minutes.,,,,
60,120, I just wanna work overtime so I could make more money so.,,,,
60,119, Yeah.,,,,
60,120, Pay you back because I am indebted.  ,,,,
69,138," Time management, right?",,,,
69,137," Yeah, and um..and I-I thought we should take this seriously.",,,,
69,138," Sure, yeah. It?s a nice opportunity.",,,,
69,137," Um..so,  I mean-what, you want to start with what you were saying?",,,,
69,138, It might be easier to remember the boxes part. Do you remember?,,,,
69,137," I remember the boxes part I was actually a little, like, confused about a little or like I was just like ?",,,,
69,138," Yeah, it took me a minute.",,,,
69,137, Well I mean-do you want to share?,,,,
69,138," So I think it said us-discussing a, like disagreement, right?",,,,
69,137, Yeah.,,,,
69,138," Um..so I think-like the-the causes to that-under that was, I put ?understanding each other? and ?problem solving? and I think under that I put um..?framing the issue,? ?articulating feelings,? and ?looking for solutions? and I think under that I put ?compassionately introspecting together.?",,,,
69,137, I have things that are kind of similar  but I ?,,,,
69,138,  Yeah? Do you remember?,,,,
69,137," What do you want to specifically talk about with this? I mean I guess the-the thing isn?t like totally like a disagreement, it just feels like we can?t really come to a conclusion on what to do ? I guess the-the disagreement with me was that I don?t-I don?t think it?s a good idea for you to spend time during the day when you?re supposed to be job searching like, after you get up like napping and playing video games and  doing Pokmon Go. And I think you think that there is space for that in your day?",,,,
69,138,  Mhm.,,,,
69,138," Well, we shouldn?t lump those altogether either because those are each separate things. Like the Pokmon Go has become most interesting ?cause of the legendary stuff. Is that-I haven?t done Ha-Harrade in like four days now. Um..I mean the root of the issue is that like, you know, I?m not gonna like, nap if I?m not tired.  Um..I like-sometimes another issue is like-like, I feel too lazy to see myself and so then I don?t have the energy to like focus on something. Um..I mean, we can kind of fix that if we get off to a good start with a good breakfast. Um..or I just plan ahead a little the night before,  think of something I can have that?s not hard in the morning. Um ?",,,,
69,137,  Mhm.  Mhm.,,,,
69,137, So you feel like it?s kind of maybe an issue of you like getting yourself started in the morning and not so much you just like doing things that are making you distracted?,,,,
69,138," Uh..it can be either. Um..it?s like, so-yeah, like, this is kind of framed as a disagreement between us but it?s like-I feel like it?s mostly an internal disagreement in myself about like what kind of life I want to live .  Or ?",,,,
69,137,  Well I mean I guess I feel like you need to set stronger limits with yourself and exercise more self-control.,,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137, Do you disagree with that?,,,,
69,138," No, that sounds true.",,,,
69,137, I don?t know- where?s the disagreement?,,,,
69,138, I?ve never been-never been really that good with that.,,,,
69,137, I mean this hasn?t like-this is probably a high-conflict area in our relationship.,,,,
69,138, Mhm.,,,,
69,137, Um..,,,,
69,138," I?m wondering if they um..gleamed that from what we put as disagreements between us.  Yeah? But it?s possible this is just the one issue that they give to people because there are probably  not that many couples that are like, ?Oh, well we manage our time for everything.? I mean . ?Cause what if we just put like really weird issues?",,,,
69,137,  .  I don?t know if we?re .,,,,
69,137, .,,,,
69,138,"  then they?d be like, ?Okay, discuss..? ? .",,,,
69,137,  don?t-I want to get back on track so that they can ?,,,,
69,138, Right. Time.,,,,
69,137, .,,,,
69,138, . Um..,,,,
69,137," I mean I guess I?m like just concerned that this is not really healthy behavior that you can?t like, start at a certain time like, um, productively working and setting limits on leisure time until you?ve gotten enough done. I-I guess I feel like it?s reasonable to expect that like if I leave at like 9 in the morning and I get back at like 5, that like you should?ve also started off working at like 9 in the morning and  just have gotten a lot of stuff done and be ready  .",,,,
69,138,"  Yeah.  Well,  job search is kind of exceptional, too.",,,,
69,138," Because if I just had a job to go to, I would go and then  .",,,,
69,137,"  I mean, but that was the issue with the last place. You didn?t always go.",,,,
69,138," Yeah, but that was kind of an-also an issue with that place. But, um.. ?",,,,
69,137," Well I guess I also just want reassurance that like once you find a job ? that this is like a temporary thing ? once you find a job that you?ll like have a schedule that closely matches mine ? I won?t get back at 5 and you won?t be there because you need to catch up because you didn?t get to work on time.  You know, so I can get . To the extent that you think like that  distracting things will like ?",,,,
69,138,"  I mean, it?s not easy for me to predict that but I?m pretty confident that, like, I would be really intentional about doing that ?  I?m able to  office and  or something?",,,,
69,137," To the extent that you think that like distracting things like, um..you know, watching videos on the internet, etcetera, um..could make you like late for work, do you-do you think you can draw like limits like ?I?m not going to do that? if it becomes an issue with you?",,,,
69,138, Mhm.,,,,
69,137, Can you keep those?,,,,
69,138, Yes.,,,,
69,137," But you haven?t been able to in the past. Maybe you haven?t-maybe you just haven?t like, used the job search the way I have.",,,,
69,138," Well, yeah, that?s the thing. It?s less that I?m like intent on accomplishing something and then I get distracted ? like, the last week it was more like I wasn?t sure what job I was searching for or why,  so ?",,,,
69,137,"  But there were other things that needed to get done, too, like  the banking notes ?",,,,
69,138,  I did do a bunch of random chores and stuff.,,,,
69,137," Yeah, you did. That?s true. That?s true. I guess it?s hard for me to have a sense of what really happens when I go. Um..and just like us yesterday, ?cause we spent most of the day together ?cause I didn?t have, um, class in the afternoon, I guess, um..I guess I was worried that you were just lying down a lot and maybe you were just exceptionally tired but I also almost feel like you gave out ?cause you?re depressed. Um..",,,,
69,138," Sometimes you?re supposed to-yeah, I mean like another  of this is, like, sometimes I have to stay up late doing extra tasks for the household and then that makes me both kind of like, a little activated so I don?t really want to go to sleep right away and I feel like, ?Oh, I like, want to take a little time off.?",,,,
69,137," Well then maybe we need to find a solution ? I mean I know have like, these physical limitations that makes doing all that hard, but maybe we need to find a solution where I?d-I do more or we like figure out a better time table ?cause it just doesn?t seem acceptable that like household tasks will be ruining your sleep every night and then ruining your next day every day, you know what I mean?",,,,
69,138," Well yeah, I mean I don?t think it?s doing that every night  .",,,,
69,137,  I mean it?s like they don?t leave you with that much to do when I go to bed. But maybe I?m underestimating it.,,,,
69,138," Sometimes you are and sometimes I?m just like, being self-indulgent or whatever.",,,,
69,137, ?Cause the last few nights I feel like it was just a couple dishes. I?m  .,,,,
69,138,  Well I spent like almost two hours trying to park the car last night.,,,,
69,137, I didn?t know that you were doing that. Didn?t know you were in a parking for last night.,,,,
69,138, Didn?t want to wake you up to tell you. But I would?ve had to move it by 8 today and then I would?ve probably have to drive around for an hour and a half looking for parking this morning so it seemed better to do it last night.,,,,
69,137, Well maybe tomorrow you can go put it on Wednesday?s spot.,,,,
69,138," Yeah, I think so.",,,,
69,137," Okay. But yeah. Well, I think-hm..",,,,
69,138, Is this still on the theme of time management?,,,,
69,137," I mean I guess there could be better-I mean, you could?ve done that today. I mean  yesterday. Like during the time when it would?ve been really easy to move the car. Where they have a  spot open. You know why that didn?t happen? That could?ve been because of me, I just don?t remember.",,,,
69,138,  Yesterday?  Really?,,,,
69,138," I feel like it was? I feel like we got back and we were hungry and we had to eat and then it was, like, 12 something or 1 something, and then there was not time. Or maybe I could?ve tried to move the car when I was like, running to Walgreens or something?",,,,
69,137," I-I  did feel like yesterday you were doing like-you were doing like running around the errands rather than like-I guess that like you?re doing that as a form of pseudo-productivity or procrastination, possibly?",,,,
69,138,  Right?,,,,
69,138, A little bit but they also needed to be done.,,,,
69,137," Yeah, well I think that happens though with you ? sometimes you?re like,  ?Well something has to be done,? but like, some things have to be done earlier.",,,,
69,138,  Mhm.,,,,
69,138, But did I have to write that cover letter yesterday?,,,,
69,137, Well you really wanted us-I mean you said you wanted to submit it so that someone could read it.,,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137," So, uh ?",,,,
69,138, But I didn?t and it?s fine.  ,,,,
69,137,"  I just don?t want that sort of lackadaisical attitude to continue  . . I mean, I just was concerned by what I saw with Joel like with your last job and I just don?t want-I just don?t want this to become a serious source of stress in our relationship where I feel like I have to push you  to complete what you need to complete or that you?ll-you?ll like procrastinate during times that we?re not together so you?re working on things during time we could spend together.",,,,
69,138,"  Well yeah, obviously I?m not going to take that attitude with like litigation.  Mhm.",,,,
69,138," Mhm. I mean I guess we can also figure out more like, refreshing ways to spend time together, like activities we can do if you?re up for it.",,,,
69,137," Yeah, I think like that too rather than just sitting at home.",,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137," Like, for sure, I agree with that.",,,,
69,138, Because sometimes that makes me feel kind of claustrophobic  and so then I actually don?t feel restored.,,,,
69,137,  I ?,,,,
69,137," I could actual-well you know what, I think we could do a lot better with that. Maybe we should um..I think outdoor activities would be nice. Like go out when it?s nice. My like health  is getting better. Part of this isn?t like a health thing ? I like  feel so exhausted but um..like going out to the park would be really nice. More often, maybe we can do that.",,,,
69,138,  Mhm.  Yeah of course.,,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137," Maybe we can um..think of some other things in our area that might be nice. We could?ve talked to those gardening people about joining the community garden, maybe.",,,,
69,138," Well, yeah.",,,,
69,137," Maybe we can send an email about that later.  I think-I do think you?re right, that like the leisure time we spend together is often like very uh..stay-in-the-housey kind of stuff and we can definitely feel more fulfilled and rested from that ?cause I feel like you do that and then you want to like play more on your computer later at night because you feel like you didn?t really relax, maybe? Is that  right?",,,,
69,138,"  Yeah.  Yeah, sort of.",,,,
69,138, I didn?t get to play.,,,,
69,137,  I mean you play a lot.,,,,
69,138," Yeah, but watching tv isn?t really playing.",,,,
69,137, So I-I guess it?s kinda like you watch tv and then you just wanna watch tv some more afterwards.,,,,
69,138, Well I watch tv and then I wanna do something like intellectually stimulating afterwards.,,,,
69,137," Oh, and that?s why like, a video game  or something? I see.",,,,
69,138,  Mhm.,,,,
69,137," Okay. Well, we can like work on like ?",,,,
69,138," I also want to get back into having more like, creative outlets doing that. I mean I can?t really paint at night ?cause it?s like a lot of stuff to take out and then it?s like all in the way in the morning  and then you have to leave the stuff there like a few days at a time.  Yeah, yeah.",,,,
69,137,"  Or you could draw sometimes. We could do like, the coloring books.  Or something.",,,,
69,137, Or we could think of other things.,,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137, We could play Pictionary.  That could be fun. Something like that. That?s a good point. I feel like getting a piano so we can just play piano.,,,,
69,138, Oh yeah.,,,,
69,137," Or we should like actuall-you know, I think we might of actually made a really good point about like us not using the time we do have together in ways that really make us feel as like, fulfilled as we could be.",,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137," So, it?s a really good point.",,,,
69,138, So that may chip away at the time management thing from the other end a little bit.,,,,
69,137," Well maybe if you have that like other time to look forward to you can be a little stricter with yourself  in other times like ?Oh well,  you know..? ?",,,,
69,138,"  Yeah.  I also still feel like I might benefit from more-ha-having like, more friends to do other activities with or something.",,,,
69,137, You feel like I?m holding you back from having friends?,,,,
69,138," No, but I just don?t really have friends.",,,,
69,137, I mean you do  have friends.,,,,
69,138,  Other than our mutual friends.,,,,
69,137," I mean, but you can independently hang out with our mutual friends.",,,,
69,138," In theory, yeah but ?",,,,
69,137, And you have Catherine and Bianca and Manon and Jeff and Liz and ?,,,,
69,138," Yeah but I?ve never really hung out with them like just, ?Hey, let?s hang out  today.?",,,,
69,137,"  But yeah, I wonder why you never start, though. You never like send-like send a text and ask them to hang out with you.",,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137," It?s not like you have to make completely new friends for that to happen, you know?",,,,
69,138, Yeah. Maybe this will partly be like a self-esteem adjustment thing ? if I?m in another job I won?t feel like they?re much more busy important people than I am.,,,,
69,137," Yeah, that?s silly honey, like everyone ha-most people go through periods of unemployment, you know, and you?re not saying you?ll have to hang out with me, you?re just like, ?Oh I-I?m free Tuesday nights, want to grab a drink?? But yeah, I think finding a job would be good for you. I think it might help some of this-this sense of ?what do we do with our days now??",,,,
69,138, Mhm.,,,,
69,137, Um..I know that you feel optimistic about that. It makes me worried you feel so isolated. I feel like maybe I did that to you?,,,,
69,138, No.,,,,
69,137, Did you feel like you had friends before this relationship and they just disappeared?,,,,
69,138, Maybe I felt a little closer to Trevor and Nate but that wasn?t  anyways.,,,,
69,137," I mean, do you feel like fulfilled when you-we hang out with friends together or do you feel like you need more independent like me-by-myself-with-a-friend time?",,,,
69,138, I feel like I might benefit from a little bit of that. Though it?s not all about that either.,,,,
69,137, Is there someone specifically you think you would benefit from that with especially?,,,,
69,138, I?m not sure.,,,,
69,137, Do you feel like I?ve like invaded some of your friendships too much? Like now that I talk to Catherine or ?,,,,
69,138, No.,,,,
69,137, D-Do you want me to encourage you more to spend time with friends?,,,,
69,138, Eh.,,,,
69,137, It?s hard for me to know what to do here because I feel-I feel like I have good friendships and I feel happy since I was like  with me so I don?t-  I don?t really know how much I should or shouldn?t push you with this or what you want from me so I can help you with your own friendships. I try to make sure you?re included in my friendships.,,,,
69,138,  Uh huh.,,,,
69,138, Yeah.,,,,
69,137, Uh..,,,,
72,144," Okay, so I guess this is just talking about ?",,,,
72,143, All of your friends are stupid.,,,,
72,144, What friends I don?t have.  I ?,,,,
72,143,  That you used to have are all stupid.,,,,
72,144," The friends I used to have all played video games, that?s why.",,,,
72,143, That?s why they?re stupid.,,,,
72,144, But you like video games but just on the xbox.,,,,
72,143," No, I don?t want to spend all day of my life playing video games.",,,,
72,144, You spend all day watching tv shows.,,,,
72,143," No, that?s Youtube. We?re supposed to be talking about friendship.",,,,
72,144, Mhm. That?s because you already have friends.,,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, And I don?t have any friends.,,,,
72,143, Because you play video games all day.,,,,
72,144, That?s because you had more options to choose friends ? I didn?t because  I play games.,,,,
72,143,  Because ?,,,,
72,143, Because of white privilege.,,,,
72,144," Well I?d say that?s part of that, too. . Well, the-I guess the-the friends that I had, I don?t really get the chance to talk to them anymore because we moved away.",,,,
72,143, And they?re stupid and I don?t like them.,,,,
72,144," No, they?re not stupid.",,,,
72,143, I don?t like them.,,,,
72,144, Josh gave us money. Which he didn?t have to. . And I don?t think he ever got paid back.,,,,
72,143, Probably not.,,,,
72,144, Well I wish I could talk to Elliott more but I?m not allowed to.,,,,
72,143, ?Cause you?re stupid.,,,,
72,144, Mm. And I can?t talk to any of your friends because they don?t talk back to me.,,,,
72,143,  Because they?re busy.,,,,
72,144," No they?re not. Not hardly that busy ? I always end up talking to them for like, a month, and then suddenly they just-just ?",,,,
72,143, ?Cause you blow up people?s phones.   ,,,,
72,144, No I don?t.  ,,,,
72,143," Oh yes you do. When you get going, you get going.",,,,
72,144," W-Wait, they don?t like it because I blow up their phones?",,,,
72,143," No, but you talk too much.",,,,
72,144, Is that what they said?,,,,
72,143," Yes, many people have said that.  It?s so annoying. You don?t want ?",,,,
72,144,  Is that why ?,,,,
72,144, Is that why they don?t like me?,,,,
72,143," No, you text people at 3 o?clock in the morning.",,,,
72,144, No I don?t.,,,,
72,143, You used to.,,,,
72,144, I don?t anymore.,,,,
72,143, Not anymore ? not ever since  said that if you every do that again we?re done.,,,,
72,144, That?s because  doesn?t like being woken up.,,,,
72,143, Normal people ? people that work during the day don?t like being woken up.,,,,
72,144," Wait, he doesn?t work during normal hours anyway, he ?",,,,
72,143, Well he?s retired now but ?,,,,
72,144," Well now-now he?s retired, so now maybe he?s sleeping   double time so he?s probably sleeping at night, but  more ? actually I haven?t talked to  in a long time, either.",,,,
72,143,  Well he works ?,,,,
72,143, You like to talk about .,,,,
72,144," No, talk to  ? like he doesn?t text me.",,,,
72,143, He doesn?t talk to very much people right now.,,,,
72,144, Why? Just ?cause he?s tired?,,,,
72,143," Mm, he?s busy with a lot of things.",,,,
72,144," Oh..oh, with the bombing thing?  In Vegas?",,,,
72,143,  What?,,,,
72,143, No.,,,,
72,144," Oh, in fact there?s no bombings or shooting, but..well, I would like to meet all of your friends because you have a whole bunch of them because you went in the military, right? Is that where you met all of your friends?",,,,
72,143," Yeah, white privilege.",,,,
72,144," Not all of them are white, probably?",,,,
72,143, Most of them.,,,,
72,144," Most of the people in the mi-in the-in Jeff Hilton are white, aren?t they?",,,,
72,143," Most of the military is white, yes.",,,,
72,144," Oh really? Most of the military is white?  Oh, okay.",,,,
72,143,  Mhm.,,,,
72,144," Well, I?m okay with that. I like white people. You should be happy about that.",,,,
72,143, Oh please.,,,,
72,144, . Um... What else? How come everyone else is busy?,,,,
72,143, They have lives?,,,,
72,144, What are they doing?,,,,
72,143,"  I don?t know. I don?t text my friends every day and ask them,  ?What are you doing??",,,,
72,144,"  Well, they text you back.",,,,
72,143," No, I don?t text them very often so no they don?t.",,,,
72,144, But I  text  often and they don?t text me back.,,,,
72,143, ?Cause there?s nothing important to say.,,,,
72,144," How about, ?Hi, how are you??",,,,
72,143," Mm, that?s pointless.",,,,
72,144, That?s not pointless. They text you.,,,,
72,143, Mm..  not really.,,,,
72,144, When was the last time you got a text from a person?,,,,
72,143, This morning.,,,,
72,144, Yeah. When was the last time I got a text from a person?,,,,
72,143, I don?t know.,,,,
72,144," Like, a week ago ? actually, no. Well, if you count  I suppose, but I wouldn?t really count him right now because he?s busy helping us out. But no people who just want to say hi ? they haven?t texted me in weeks.",,,,
72,143, It?s their break.,,,,
72,144, Break from what?,,,,
72,143, You.,,,,
72,144," Why don?t you tell them, ?Say hi to ??",,,,
72,143," If they want to say hi to , they?ll say hi to .",,,,
72,144, So why don?t they want to say hi to ?,,,,
72,143,  ask them.,,,,
72,144, Well it?s going back several circular loops ?cause I do ?,,,,
72,143," You can always text someone and if they don?t respond, they don?t respond.",,,,
72,144, But why aren?t they responding to me  and respond to you?,,,,
72,143,  I don?t know.,,,,
72,144, I sort of talked to them before now so they don?t want to talk to ?,,,,
72,143, We?ll get phones and I pass the internet connection then.,,,,
72,144," Yeah, but I have the same number that I texted them before at.  ",,,,
72,143," Yeah, you don?t spell correctly when you text from that phone.",,,,
72,144, I spell correctly?,,,,
72,143," No, you spell incorrectly on phones that whole time frame.",,,,
72,144," Oh, well then that one I guess I have to , but could just text me on the iPhone ? nevermind, you?re always using the iPad.",,,,
72,143,"  Mhm, ?cause it?s my iPad. I bought the iPad.",,,,
72,144, I think  texting you on the phone.,,,,
72,143, That?s right.,,,,
72,144," No. Maybe that?s why. .  Is there a way-should I tell them, ?This is [Subject 144]?? Would they know who I am?",,,,
72,143," Mm, I don?t think they care.  No.",,,,
72,144, Why not?,,,,
72,143," They know who you are, they know what number you?re texting from. You have the same number.",,,,
72,144, But why don?t they just want to say hi?,,,,
72,143, Because then you blow up their phones and you don?t stop.,,,,
72,144, So that?s why they don?t want to talk to me.,,,,
72,143, Maybe it?s their break time from you right now.,,,,
72,144," No, really. That?s why they don?t  respond to ?",,,,
72,143,  I don?t know. I haven?t asked anybody.,,,,
72,144,Then can you ask someone?,,,,
72,143,  No ?cause I don?t care.,,,,
72,144," Oh my god, Sam. Then can I text someone you?re texting?",,,,
72,143, No.,,,,
72,144, Why not?,,,,
72,143, ?Cause then that?s creepy.,,,,
72,144," No, tell them, ?This is Sam.?",,,,
72,143," Yeah, that?s creepy. They?re like-?cause you?re going-you?re-they?re not texting you directly so you?re gonna use mine to text them.",,,,
72,144," Okay, then I?ll log into my  number on the iPad and text them. Can I do that?",,,,
72,143, No one will respond.  .,,,,
72,144," Like  hasn?t texted me back but he knows my regular phone number, and um,  from Colorado, he hasn?t ever texted me.",,,,
72,143, I don?t talk to  very often.,,,,
72,144," You just said you talk to him like, a week ago.",,,,
72,143," No I didn?t. You asked who I talked to. I didn?t say-you didn?t say, ?Ask .? You said have I talked to someone. I said yes.  But you said ?",,,,
72,144,  Talked to .,,,,
72,143, No I did not. Not that .,,,,
72,144, Oh. Well. . Is it all by text free that you talk to people on?,,,,
72,143, I don?t use the phone for anything.,,,,
72,144, Um..um..what else?,,,,
72,143, You?re always wanting to hang with everyone  all the time.,,,,
72,144,"  Oh, wasn?t  supposed to be coming?",,,,
72,143, What?,,,,
72,144,  supposed to be coming?,,,,
72,143, Not this weekend ? not til this weekend.,,,,
72,144, Saturday?,,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, Who was that?,,,,
72,143, My- ? I don?t know.,,,,
72,144, You ?,,,,
72,143," No, I don?t remember.",,,,
72,144," Oh, what happened to ?",,,,
72,143, Hm?,,,,
72,144, What happened to ?,,,,
72,143, I don?t know.,,,,
72,144, You never heard anything?,,,,
72,143," No, I just talked to him. I don?t remember what I was talking to him about.",,,,
72,143, I talk to him .,,,,
72,143, But we know better now.,,,,
72,144, You could push some of them onto my phone.,,,,
72,143," No, ?cause then you?re gonna blow up their phone at 3 o?clock in the morning.",,,,
72,144, No I?m not gonna-is that what you?re really worried about?,,,,
72,143,"  No, I?m not worried about it at all. I don?t care.",,,,
72,144, Then why don?t you push some of them onto my phone so I can say hi to them?,,,,
72,143, Because you?re busy enough ? you do-you have  long naps ?,,,,
72,144,  I have enough?,,,,
72,143," You have enough to do on a day-to-day basis.  You still have  to do, you still have to go get me my food, you have to-you have a lot of stuff to do.",,,,
72,144,  Enough of ?,,,,
72,143, Wifely duties.,,,,
72,144, Thought you were gonna say white duties. ?Cause I?m the Help. Save white privilege. You think you?re above everyone else sitting in that chair.,,,,
72,143,"  Oh yeah, that-that?s what it was going through my head.",,,,
72,144, Was  planning on doing anything for us today?,,,,
72,143, I don?t know.  .,,,,
72,144, He is a friend.,,,,
72,143,  Not to you. .,,,,
72,144,"  Oh, funny. What about ? Did you hear anything about ?",,,,
72,143," No, I haven?t heard of him.",,,,
72,144, Or his assistant?,,,,
72,143, Nope.,,,,
72,144," Oh my god. Oh, what about uh, um, ?",,,,
72,143,  He is not one of our friends.,,,,
72,144, Those are friends.,,,,
72,143," You are going into plans, not ?",,,,
72,144," Yes, well we talked about friends, so what about ?",,,,
72,143," What? Why, I haven?t heard from him.",,,,
72,144," Wasn?t he-oh no, that was-that was ?",,,,
72,144," Yeah, what about ?",,,,
72,143, Uh-uh.,,,,
72,144, Wasn?t he supposed to resend you the email that you lost somehow?,,,,
72,143, He probably forgot.,,,,
72,144,How did you lose his email?,,,,
72,143," I don?t know, I probably deleted it.",,,,
72,144, Why would the hell would you delete that if  he told you ?,,,,
72,143,  I deleted-if-if-if-if it looks like a scam then I automatically delete it.,,,,
72,144,I can?t ?,,,,
72,143," If it had anything in the subject line that?s suspicious, it?s deleted.",,,,
72,144,But you told me you-you-you got it.,,,,
72,143, I looked at it and then I might?ve accidentally swiped it.,,,,
72,144, Why would you do that?,,,,
72,143, ?Cause I do it every day ? I get so many junk emails.,,,,
72,144," Oh my god, Jesus. Can?t you just save it?",,,,
72,143," No, junk email is a big part of my inbox.",,,,
72,144, Put it in the junk email folder. . And somehow you lost that and we needed his card number from that.,,,,
72,143, Do you not like our ?,,,,
72,144, Mm.,,,,
72,143, You liked him.,,,,
72,144, You?re always bringing up .,,,,
72,143, He?s a good buddy.,,,,
72,144," Geez, you really got close though ? wasn?t he from Fort Angeles?",,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, Oh God. And how was it that he was in ?,,,,
72,143, ?Cause he?s a marine.,,,,
72,144, No. He was? Oh. . Do you have any other friends in New York?,,,,
72,143, Uh-uh.,,,,
72,144, No?,,,,
72,143," No, I don?t know. I do-I haven?t lived here for a long, long time.",,,,
72,144," No, I mean like did you-do you know anyone that moved out here?",,,,
72,143, No.,,,,
72,144," Oh. I guess not many people want to move out to New York. Ugh, I want to see  soon.",,,,
72,143,  Don?t move the table.,,,,
72,144," He said that ?s doing well. That?s the last I heard from him. He said he was supposed to send us a Western Union but I haven?t heard back from that, either.",,,,
72,143, It?s a long 15 minutes.,,,,
72,144, Seems like it.,,,,
72,144, Um..,,,,
72,143, Who talks about friends for 15 minutes?,,,,
72,144,  You apparently don?t. . Is  still on vacation? Or did he come back?,,,,
72,143, Uh-uh. He came back and then he left again.,,,,
72,144, So he is back on vacation.,,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, Oh. Wh-where is he?,,,,
72,143, I don?t know.,,,,
72,144, Someplace tropical?,,,,
72,144," He likes tropics, doesn?t he? Did he take all his-his kids?",,,,
72,143, Except .,,,,
72,144, Well that?s his older ones.,,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, Really? They just-they all just went?,,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144, How did he get all those kids to come all at once at the same time ? don?t they have things to do?,,,,
72,143," ?s his old ?  and uh, the Asian one are the only ones that are in school. The rest are in graduate.",,,,
72,144," Yeah, but he?s got a bunch of younger ones, I thought.",,,,
72,143, Hm?,,,,
72,144, I thought he had a whole bunch ?,,,,
72,143,"  and uh, the Asian.  The rest are all-the rest-the only other one would gradate-just graduated high school.",,,,
72,144,  The rest ?,,,,
72,144," I know, but I thought he had like-didn?t he have, those, I-I know Chloe had two-I thought he adopted a bunch of little kids.",,,,
72,143, Uh-uh.,,,,
72,144, Not even his foster kids?,,,,
72,143, No. They don?t take them anywhere.,,,,
72,144, Shit. Why not?,,,,
72,143, What did you say?,,,,
72,144, Why not?,,,,
72,143, He-I don?t think he has any foster kids right now anymore.,,,,
72,144, But he doesn?t take them anywhere?,,,,
72,143," No, he does when he has them but I don?t think he has any right now.",,,,
72,144, Oh. What about that-they said he had a red-headed foster kid.,,,,
72,143," Yeah, I don?t think he has him anymore.",,,,
72,144, What happened to him?,,,,
72,143, I don?t know. Sometimes they go back to their family or they go to a different home.,,,,
72,144, He gave him up?,,,,
72,143," Yeah, but foster kids don?t stay forever.",,,,
72,144," I know, but that?s so sad. How could he just give him up like that?",,,,
72,143,"  Oh God, he was a little kid. We all know.",,,,
72,144, Don?t you think that?s sad?,,,,
72,143," No. We?re talking about friends, not foster kids.",,,,
72,144," Yeah,   foster kids .",,,,
72,143,"No, I don?t feel sad.",,,,
72,144,"I think it?s horrible. Well, maybe .",,,,
72,143," By the way, you sucked at that. Now we?re not going to talk about that anymore.",,,,
72,144, Oh. Okay. Um.. ?,,,,
72,143, Don?t break the chair.,,,,
72,144, How am I going to break the chair?,,,,
72,143, You?re rocking it back and forth.,,,,
72,144, You can break the chair .,,,,
72,143,  doing more laundry.,,,,
72,144,"Doesn?t matter. I can?t make friends anyway else. Sort them out. That was kind of funny, after the fact.",,,,
72,143," My friends are smarter than you, though.",,,,
72,144, No they?re not.,,,,
72,143, Sam?s smarter than you.,,,,
72,144, Please.,,,,
72,143, Sam?s smarter than you.,,,,
72,144,"  Sam is a mutant,  is a mutant, and  is a mutant.",,,,
72,143, You think everyone that?s smarter than you is a mutant.,,,,
72,144," Yeah,  a mutant. They?re all kind of mutants. I?m sure- is a half-mutant.",,,,
72,143, Sam?s probably smarter than you.,,,,
72,144," No, no. I don?t believe that.   got lucky. Oh, no. Oh-well, it?s interesting. So I think ?s smarter than me in computers definitely ? I can?t compete with him in that. I know that. Uh, , I?m not too much about him although I feel like he?s good at math. That was the only thing. To what extent in math, I have no idea, but..",,,,
72,143,  We already know.,,,,
72,143,  is probably smarter than you.,,,,
72,144," Oh God, no. Sorry. That one?s definitely not true. You told me that he asked you what ovulation meant.",,,,
72,143, Mhm.,,,,
72,144," Yeah, okay. Yeah, sure. But he?s  so I give him-I give him  for that. Isn?t he going back to school?",,,,
72,143, I don?t think so anymore.,,,,
72,144," Aw, he should really do that.",,,,
